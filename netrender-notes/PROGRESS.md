# netrender notes index

This file is the short index to the surviving plans in
`netrender-notes/`. The repo is post-cleanup: vello is the sole
rasterizer on `main`, the upstream WebRender codebase (`webrender_api/`,
`wrench/`, `wr_glyph_rasterizer/`, etc.) has been removed and lives on
the `webrender-wgpu-upstream/` side worktree if anyone needs to spelunk
through the original implementation.

## Current canonical plans

These two are the source of truth for the live architecture.

- [`2026-04-30_netrender_design_plan.md`](2026-04-30_netrender_design_plan.md)
  — the parent plan: phases 0.5 → 12, axioms, crate split rationale,
  Scene API contract, render-task graph, tile cache, axiom 14
  compositor seam. Most of phases 1–9 landed; 10/11/12 still pending
  per the vello plan's §12 phase mapping.

- [`2026-05-01_vello_rasterizer_plan.md`](2026-05-01_vello_rasterizer_plan.md)
  — the vello pivot, runtime-verified through phase 7'. Replaces the
  parent plan's batched-WGSL rasterizer. Status block at the top
  records which §11 spike outcomes cleared. Phase 7' (Masonry pattern
  tile cache) is the architectural heart and is delivered.

  **Post-pivot findings landed since (2026-05-04):** persistent
  per-frame image cache (§11.9 wart, see also §11.16 polish), op-list
  refactor with consumer-push painter order (§11.11),
  variable-radius box-shadow blur via cascaded passes (§11.10),
  `FontBlob` unified to `peniko::Blob<u8>` (§11.9), nested layers +
  arbitrary-path clips via `SceneOp::PushLayer/PopLayer` (§11.14),
  hit testing — stack-returning, layer-clip-aware, per-glyph
  approximate (§11.12, §11.15, §11.16), `netrender_text` parley
  adapter with decoration painting (§4.4 status block, §11.16),
  edition-2021 bump, `Scene::clear_ops` helper. Test count: 105
  passing, 1 ignored, 0 failed across the workspace.

  Open items live in the feature roadmap (§11.99 was folded out
  for findability):
  [`2026-05-04_feature_roadmap.md`](2026-05-04_feature_roadmap.md)
  — Phase R (open refinements / wart fixes) + Phases A–G (new
  capability, diagnostics first).

## Active follow-up plans (small scope)

- [`2026-05-04_feature_roadmap.md`](2026-05-04_feature_roadmap.md)
  — Phase R (open refinements / wart fixes — was §11.99 of the
  rasterizer plan) + Phases A–G (new capability: diagnostics
  first, then consumer-pull-imminent, then SceneOp expansions,
  then architecturally-significant, then companion lanes).
- [`2026-05-05_compositor_handoff_path_b_prime.md`](2026-05-05_compositor_handoff_path_b_prime.md)
  — axiom-14 native-compositor handoff via path (b′). Sub-phases
  5.1–5.4 shipped on netrender side (commit `9447a852b`); 5.5
  servo-wgpu adapter pending in separate workspace. Roadmap entry:
  D3.
- [`2026-05-06_webgl_over_wgpu_plan.md`](2026-05-06_webgl_over_wgpu_plan.md)
  — WebGL-over-wgpu companion lane. G0–G6 sequence, gated on
  Serval/Pelt consumer pull. Roadmap entry: G.
- [`draw_context_plan.md`](draw_context_plan.md)
- [`typed_pipeline_metadata_plan.md`](typed_pipeline_metadata_plan.md)
- [`texture_cache_cleanup_plan.md`](texture_cache_cleanup_plan.md)
- [`wasm-portability-checklist.md`](wasm-portability-checklist.md)
  — note: this is for the WebRender wgpu-backend branch (separate
  project), retained for reference. A netrender-specific portability
  list will be authored when F2 (wasm) triggers.
- [`servo_wgpu_integration.md`](servo_wgpu_integration.md)
  — downstream Servo integration notes; host/device-sharing shape

## Historical / superseded — archived

The plans below predate the vello pivot or have collapsed into other
docs. They describe approaches that are no longer the path forward
or work that has been completed and rolled into the canonical plans.
All have been moved under [`archive/`](archive/) — kept for
historical context, not for guidance.

**Activated and folded:**

- [`archive/2026-05-05_deferred_phases.md`](archive/2026-05-05_deferred_phases.md)
  — was the holding pen for three architecturally-significant
  deferrals (12c' backdrop filter, 13' compositor handoff,
  linear-light blending). All three activated 2026-05-05; canonical
  entries now live on the roadmap as D1, D3, R9. Doc retained as
  the activation history record.

**Pre-vello-pivot (the WebRender wgpu-backend lane):**

- `archive/2026-04-28_idiomatic_wgsl_pipeline_plan.md` — the
  idiomatic-wgpu-pipeline branch's approach (authored WGSL only, no GL,
  no SPIR-V intermediate). Was the active plan before the vello pivot;
  preserved on its own branch (`idiomatic-wgpu-pipeline`).
- `archive/2026-04-28_renderer_body_wgpu_adapter_plan.md` — `WgpuDevice`
  adapter early-stage planning. Subsumed by netrender_device's
  current shape.
- `archive/2026-04-29_pipeline_first_migration_plan.md` — typed-pipeline
  migration, batch-builder discussion. Pre-cleanup.
- `archive/2026-04-30_phase_d_rollback_to_skeleton.md` — record of the
  rollback that preceded the netrender split.
- `archive/2026-04-30_servo_wgpu_integration_assessment.md` — pre-fork
  servo-integration assessment.
- `archive/2026-04-08_live_full_reftest_confirmation.md` — last
  GL/wrench reftest confirmation before the fork (412/412 passing).
  Now load-bearing prior art for the WebGL-over-wgpu plan §3.1.
- `archive/2026-04-18_spirv_shader_pipeline_plan.md` — dead direction.
- `archive/2026-04-18_upstream_cherry_pick_plan.md` — superseded by the
  fork.
- `archive/2026-04-21_spirv_pipeline_reset_execution.md` — superseded.
- `archive/2026-04-22_upstream_cherry_pick_reevaluation.md` —
  superseded.
- `archive/2026-04-24_tile_with_spacing_validation_error.md` —
  historical bug diagnostic.
- `archive/2026-04-26_track3_legacy_assembly_isolation_lane.md` —
  superseded.
- `archive/2026-04-27_dual_servo_parity_plan.md` — superseded by the
  fork.
- `archive/2026-04-28_session_brief.md` — historical session note.
- `archive/2026-03-01_webrender_wgpu_renderer_implementation_plan.md` —
  the original convergence history, no longer canonical.

## Local-only

- `archive/` — dated progress snapshots and older branch-shape notes,
  kept for historical traceability.
- `logs/` — local-only, gitignored except for its `.gitignore`. Only
  retain artifacts supporting an active note or unresolved diagnostic.
