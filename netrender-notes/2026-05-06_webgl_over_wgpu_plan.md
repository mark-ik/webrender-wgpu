# netrender — WebGL-over-wgpu lane (2026-05-06)

Sub-plan extracted from
[`2026-05-04_feature_roadmap.md`](2026-05-04_feature_roadmap.md) Phase G.
Lives as its own design doc because the work is multi-month and reaches
beyond netrender's API surface; the roadmap holds a single pointer entry.

## 1. Why this is a separate lane

Web pages do not get raw OpenGL; they get WebGL/WebGL2. The target
architecture is **WebGL API compatibility over wgpu**, not GL retention.
This lane should live beside NetRender, not inside NetRender core:

```text
WebGL DOM binding / canvas context
    -> WebGL-over-wgpu state machine + validator + translator
    -> wgpu Texture output for the canvas
    -> NetRender / Pelt composites that texture into the page scene
```

NetRender's job is the final composition surface: place the canvas
texture in painter order, clip/transform it, and participate in damage
and presentation. It should not own WebGL's API state machine,
extension matrix, shader-language validation, draw-call validation, or
resource-lifetime semantics.

The alternative wgpu-graft / external-producer bridge remains a
stopgap: useful for importing an existing producer's texture when a
consumer forces it, but not the strategic implementation path. Do not
let it become the WebGL plan unless there is immediate external
pressure.

## 2. Sub-phases

Each phase ships independently; later phases depend on earlier ones.
G4 is the only sub-phase that lands inside the netrender repo; G0–G3
and G5–G6 are sibling-crate or test-infra work.

### G0. Ownership and crate boundary

*Shape:* create a sibling WebGL-over-wgpu adapter crate under the
Serval/Pelt side, with NetRender only seeing a produced
`wgpu::Texture` / `TextureView` / surface handle plus size, format,
alpha mode, generation, and damage metadata.

*Done condition:* a `webgl_canvas_to_netrender_texture` smoke compiles
without `glow`, GLES, EGL, WGL, ANGLE, or ServoShell dependencies.

### G1. WebGL 1 baseline state machine

**FIRST POST-W4 RUNG CLEARED 2026-05-12.**
`servo-webgl-wgpu` now has WebGL-shaped element-array state for the
first indexed geometry path: `ElementArrayBuffer`, `buffer_data_u16`,
`IndexType::UnsignedShort`, and `draw_elements`. The receipt covers a
green indexed triangle plus an out-of-range index rejection path that
reports `InvalidOperation`. This clears the "indexed geometry" rung of
the G1 done condition.

**G1 FIRST BASELINE CLOSED 2026-05-12.**
The remaining first-baseline gaps now have receipts too:
`viewport` plus explicit scissor-test clipping, RGBA8 2D texture
upload/bind state, texture-backed framebuffer rendering/readback, and
RGBA8 renderbuffer attachment/clear/readback. Together with the prior
triangle, indexed geometry, resize, context-loss, and error receipts,
this clears the G1 done condition as written here: the adapter can now
exercise geometry / texture / framebuffer scenes through its first
WebGL-shaped wgpu state machine.

*Shape:* implement the minimum WebGL 1 context object over wgpu:
buffers, vertex attributes, textures, framebuffers, renderbuffers,
viewport/scissor, clear, drawArrays, drawElements, readPixels, context
loss, and WebGL error generation. Start with the canonical validation
behavior, not a "whatever wgpu accepts" wrapper.

*Done condition:* a tiny conformance subset renders triangle / indexed
geometry / texture / framebuffer scenes into an RGBA8 wgpu texture,
then readback matches expected pixels.

### G2. GLSL ES validation and WGSL translation

**NEXT VALIDATOR WIDENING CLEARED 2026-05-12.**
The canonical fragment parser now accepts stacked leading precision
declarations when there is exactly one valid float precision contract
plus additional standard `int` precision declarations, and it rejects
duplicate float precision declarations. This keeps the runtime
translator seam narrow while moving it closer to ordinary ESSL shader
headers.

**FIRST SAMPLER LANE CLEARED 2026-05-12.**
The canonical translator/runtime now accepts the first texture sampling
pair: position + UV vertex attributes, a `varying vec2`, and a fragment
`uniform sampler2D` lowered through naga into WGSL-backed texture plus
sampler bindings. Runtime receipts cover successful textured draw
readback and the missing-bound-texture `InvalidOperation` path. This
closes the current sampler rung, not the larger G2 translator/validator
program below: the archived-translator port, broader built-ins, richer
sampler variants, compile/link diagnostics, and CTS gates still belong
to G2.a-G2.d.

**SAMPLER UNIT STATE CLEARED 2026-05-12.**
Sampler uniforms are no longer hardwired to texture unit 0. The adapter
now tracks a bounded WebGL-shaped active texture unit set, binds 2D
textures per unit, lets `uniform1i` select the sampled unit, rejects
out-of-range active texture and sampler-unit values, and validates that
the selected unit has a bound/uploaded texture at draw time. Receipts
cover unit-1 sampling over a distinct unit-0 texture, invalid unit
state, and the original unit-0 sampler path.

**FRAMEBUFFER COMPLETENESS RUNG CLEARED 2026-05-12.**
Framebuffer objects now expose a WebGL-shaped completeness query and
surface `InvalidFramebufferOperation` for `clear`, `drawArrays`, and
`readPixels` against an incomplete bound framebuffer. The first status
model distinguishes the default complete framebuffer, missing color
attachments, and invalid attachments; texture-backed and
renderbuffer-backed color attachments remain complete and continue to
render/read back. Receipts cover attach and detach transitions across
texture/renderbuffer color targets plus rejection of incomplete-
framebuffer clear/read/draw paths.

**FIRST VALIDATOR / LINKING RUNG CLEARED 2026-05-12.**
The adapter now exposes WebGL-shaped shader/program lifecycle state
instead of only the convenience `create_program_from_essl` helper:
explicit vertex/fragment shader objects, source upload, compile status,
shader info logs, attach/link flow, program link status, and program
info logs. The old helper remains as a wrapper over that lifecycle so
existing smoke paths stay terse. Receipts cover an explicit compile /
link / draw success path, a fragment compile failure that produces a
shader log without manufacturing a GL error, and a varying-interface
link failure that produces a program log and blocks `useProgram`.
This is the first concrete G2.c validator/linking slice; it does not
replace the larger translator-port or CTS work still called out below.

*Shape:* treat GLSL ES as the web-facing language contract and WGSL as
the device language. The adapter must validate WebGL shader rules
before pipeline creation, translate to WGSL or an intermediate form
that produces WGSL, and preserve WebGL's attribute/uniform/linking
semantics. Do not make authored GL runtime shader text part of
NetRender.

**Strategy: extend the existing webrender-wgpu translator, don't start
fresh.** Full analysis in [§3 below](#3-g2-translation-strategy). The
short version: a complete GLSL→naga→WGSL translator already exists in
the `webrender_build/src/wgsl.rs` archive (412/412 wgpu reftests
passing on 2026-04-08; 413/413 after the wgpu 29 bump on 2026-04-10).
Port that as the baseline, drop the WebRender-only passes, replace
precision-stripping with ESSL precision-propagation, and build the
WebGL validator as a separate layer above the translator.

*Done condition:* compile/link tests cover vertex+fragment pairs,
attribute binding, uniforms/samplers, precision qualifiers, common
built-ins, failed compile/link diagnostics, and a small fragment
shader rendering oracle.

*Sub-phases* (sequenced inside G2 for clarity; details in §3):

- **G2.a** — port the existing translator into a runtime crate;
  re-baseline against the WebRender shader corpus as a regression gate.
- **G2.b** — extend ESSL 1.00 / 3.00 coverage (precision propagation,
  ES-only built-ins, sampler-type variants).
- **G2.c** — build the WebGL validator above the translator (linking,
  errors, ESSL grammar restrictions, undefined-behavior gating).
- **G2.d** — wire the WebGL CTS as the conformance gate; ANGLE-as-
  translator stays as a fallback, only triggered if a CTS class can't
  be cleared inside this stack.

### G3. Resource and synchronization contract

*Shape:* define when a canvas texture is ready for NetRender to
sample, how resize reallocates, how framebuffer writes become visible
to the compositor, how readPixels maps/stages data, and how context
loss tears down GPU resources. This should be a plain Pelt/Serval
contract, not an implicit side effect of a GL context.

*Done condition:* tests cover canvas resize, multiple frames,
readPixels after draw, context loss/recreation, and texture generation
changes visible to NetRender composition.

### G4. Texture compositing into NetRender (netrender-side hook)

*Shape:* expose a NetRender-side primitive or adapter helper for
externally produced wgpu textures that are on the same device. The
primitive must carry size, format, alpha, color-space, transform,
clip, and damage metadata. If cross-device import becomes necessary,
route it through a separate interop adapter; do not pollute the
same-device WebGL-over-wgpu path.

*Done condition:* a WebGL canvas texture appears in a NetRender scene
with correct z-order over text/rects, correct clipping, correct alpha,
and no readback round trip.

### G5. WebGL 2 and extension ladder

*Shape:* after WebGL 1 smoke is stable, add WebGL 2 features in
measured batches: VAOs, instancing, multiple render targets, 3D
textures, transform feedback strategy, integer textures, and the
extensions that appear in real WPT/compat pressure. Each extension
gets an explicit mapping to wgpu capability/limits.

*Done condition:* a documented feature matrix lists implemented,
intentionally unsupported, and blocked-by-wgpu-limit features; WPT
expectations point at those buckets.

### G6. Conformance and WPT gates

*Shape:* use WebGL CTS / WPT as the normative target. In-tree demos
are smoke tests only; they cannot define compatibility. Build a small
first gate, then grow it by feature bucket.

*Done condition:* CI has a named WebGL-over-wgpu smoke suite plus an
opt-in conformance job. Failures are bucketed by API validation,
shader translation, resource behavior, or rendering mismatch.

## 3. G2 translation strategy

This section captures the prior-art findings that make G2 an
extend-and-shed effort rather than a green-field build. Read before
estimating G2 scope.

### 3.1 Prior art: the webrender-wgpu GLSL→WGSL translator

A complete GLSL→naga→WGSL translation pipeline shipped on the
`wgpu-backend-0.68-minimal` branch and produced reftest-passing
results:

- **412/412 wgpu reftests passing** ([2026-04-08 live confirmation](archive/2026-04-08_live_full_reftest_confirmation.md)).
- **413/413 after the wgpu 29 bump** ([P15 progress report](archive/progress/2026-04-10_p15_progress_report.md)).
- **61/61 WGSL variants translating** for WebRender's full shader
  corpus, with every naga limitation and workaround documented in the
  [shader translation journal](archive/legacy/shader_translation_journal.md).

The translator lives at `webrender_build/src/wgsl.rs` on the
`origin/wgpu-backend-0.68-minimal` branch (~2319 lines); the driver
is `webrender/build.rs`. To inspect locally, recreate the worktree:
`git worktree add ../webrender-wgpu-upstream wgpu-backend-0.68-minimal`
(the prior worktree at that path is registered as prunable — the
branch on origin is the canonical reference).

The pipeline was retired not because it failed, but because the
April-18 SPIR-V plan attempted to remove the preprocessing tower
in favor of authored SPIR-V, and the April-28 idiomatic-WGSL plan
then dropped runtime translation entirely once the dual-consumer
(Servo GL + Servo wgpu) requirement collapsed. Translation
viability was never the failure mode.

### 3.2 Dependencies (thin)

The whole 2319-line translator depends on, for the wgsl path:

```toml
naga = { version = "26.0", features = ["glsl-in", "wgsl-out"] }
bitflags = "2"
lazy_static = "1"
```

No `tree-sitter`, LALRPOP, `shaderc`, glslang, or external
preprocessor. Naga is the only translation engine; everything else
is bespoke text passes around it (paren-balanced scanners,
word-boundary `replace_word`, line-based `#ifdef` resolution).

### 3.3 Architecture: pre-pass + naga + post-pass

```text
GLSL source
  → ~1700 lines of text passes (preprocess_for_naga)
  → ~60 lines of naga driving (translate_to_wgsl)
  → ~300 lines of text fixups on naga's WGSL output (fix_generated_wgsl)
  → wgpu pipeline
```

Three production-grade hardenings worth keeping verbatim:

- **8 MB stack thread.** Naga's validator does recursive flow
  analysis that overflows Windows' default stack on big shaders. The
  translator spawns naga on
  `std::thread::Builder::new().stack_size(8 * 1024 * 1024)`.
- **Panic catch.** `std::panic::catch_unwind` around the
  parse/validate/emit, because naga's validator can panic on
  malformed intermediate IR. For our prior corpus this was hardening;
  for adversarial WebGL input it is a load-bearing safety boundary.
- **Post-naga WGSL fixups.** Naga's *output* is patched for
  valid-but-rejected-by-wgpu WGSL constructs
  (`fix_generated_wgsl`, `strip_dead_adata_input`,
  `rewrite_set_sat_helpers`). Some may have aged out since 2026-04;
  re-baseline against current naga + wgpu before porting.

The 16 transforms factor as:

| Pass | Lines | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `resolve_stage_ifdefs` | ~100 | strip inactive `WR_VERTEX_SHADER` / `WR_FRAGMENT_SHADER` blocks |
| `move_definitions_before_prototypes` | ~265 | naga forward-dependency reorder |
| `fix_switch_fallthrough` | ~750 | 6 sub-passes for WGSL-incompatible switch shapes |
| `decompose_matrix_varyings` | ~180 | mat3/mat4 varyings → column vectors |
| `rewrite_texel_fetch_offset` | ~75 | naga `texelFetchOffset` shape |
| `decompose_array_struct_stores` | ~70 | one specific WR shader idiom |
| `rewrite_sampler_params` | ~55 | function params taking `sampler2D` |
| `strip_precision` | ~25 | drop `highp` / `mediump` / `lowp` |
| `preprocess_for_naga` driver | ~260 | sampler-split + location assignment + orchestration |

### 3.4 WebGL context: drops, reshapes, wins, reframings

WebRender's input was *our* shader corpus under a build-time tower.
WebGL's input is *page-author* GLSL ES at runtime. The asymmetry
cuts in our favor more often than against:

**Drops — WebRender-only baggage that simply doesn't apply:**

- `resolve_stage_ifdefs` (~100 lines). WebGL ships VS and FS as
  separate strings. No combined source, no `WR_VERTEX_SHADER` ifdefs.
- `PER_INSTANCE` qualifier handling. WR convention; WebGL has
  standard `attribute` / `in` and (in WebGL 2) `gl_VertexID` /
  `gl_InstanceID` built-ins.
- `decompose_array_struct_stores` (~70 lines). Existed for one WR
  shader (`ps_split_composite`).
- `webrender_build::shader::*` shader-feature flag plumbing and the
  `#include`-expansion infrastructure. WebGL has no `#include`.

Roughly 250–400 lines drop out wholesale.

**Reshapes — ESSL needs different work, not no work:**

- **Precision quals: strip → preserve and propagate.** The single
  biggest reshape. WebRender stripped `highp` / `mediump` / `lowp`
  because GLSL 4.50 rejects them; for WebGL they are load-bearing
  canonical syntax with explicit semantics (defaults vary by stage
  and type, statement-scope precision blocks are valid, ESSL 1.00
  vs 3.00 differ). The right move is a map from ESSL precision →
  WGSL storage choice, not a delete. More work, but cleaner work.
- **Sampler split: still needed, broader coverage.** WebRender hit
  `sampler2D`. WebGL has `sampler3D` (WebGL 2), `samplerCube`,
  `sampler2DArray`, `sampler2DShadow`, etc. Same shape of fix.
- **WebGL 2 = ESSL 3.00.** Naga's `glsl-in` accepts both ESSL
  versions. Two frontends instead of one, but it's a parameter to
  naga, not a separate tower.

**Wins — WebGL constraints make some passes redundant:**

- WebGL 1 forbids recursion, `goto`, dynamic-bound `for` loops in
  many profiles. The matrix-varying decomposition (~180 lines) and
  switch fall-through tower (~750 lines) handled valid-but-uncommon
  WR-corpus patterns. Switch fall-through in particular may not need
  to ship if no real WebGL CTS shader exercises it. Activate on
  demand based on conformance failures.
- WebGL has a normative test suite (WebGL CTS + WPT). The
  translator's evolution becomes test-driven instead of
  bug-by-bug. We don't guess what to support; we run CTS and see
  what fails.

**Reframings — same problem, different shape:**

- **Validation lives above translation, not inside.** WebRender
  entangled "is this shader valid" with "did it translate." For
  WebGL the spec mandates a separate validation layer above
  translation: error generation matching `getError()`, attribute /
  uniform linking checks, ESSL grammar restrictions naga doesn't
  model, undefined-behavior gating. New work, but cleaner factoring:
  validate → translate → build, three layers, three error buckets.
- **Runtime caching is meaningful.** WebRender translated 61 variants
  once at build time. WebGL pages compile shaders at runtime. A
  translator cache keyed on
  `(source_hash, essl_version, context_options)` is a real
  performance lever WebRender never needed.
- **Adversarial input.** Naga panic + stack-size wrapper changes
  posture from "production hardening" to "safety boundary." Same
  code, much higher importance.

### 3.5 Worth keeping verbatim

- Naga panic-catch + 8 MB stack-size wrapper.
- Paren-balanced function scanner.
- Word-boundary `replace_word`.
- The pre-pass / naga / post-pass three-stage architecture.
- Cross-stage binding agreement (the fixed-binding-table approach).
  WebGL's `glLinkProgram` enforces VS/FS interface matching at the
  spec level; same problem, same shape of fix.

### 3.6 Rough budget

| Category | Lines |
| --- | --- |
| WR-only passes dropped | -300 to -400 |
| ESSL precision propagation (new) | +200 to +300 |
| Sampler-type variants (extended) | +80 to +120 |
| Reused unchanged | ~1200 |
| **Translator total** | **~1400–1600** (vs. 2319 today) |
| WebGL validator layer above (new, separate module) | +800 to +1500 |
| Runtime cache | +150 to +250 |

The translator lands modestly smaller; the validator above it is
the major new build. Not a rewrite — an extend-and-shed.

### 3.7 ANGLE as escape hatch, not primary path

ANGLE-as-translator (Chromium's WebGL → SPIR-V/HLSL/MSL path) stays
in scope as a fallback only:

- If a WebGL CTS class can't be cleared inside the
  naga-derived stack despite a reasonable extension effort.
- If license, build complexity, or wasm compatibility forces it.

Until then, the journal-derived path is strictly better-leveraged:
working code, documented receipts, no external dependency.

## 4. First work lane: same-device canvas texture slice

Added 2026-05-11 after reviewing the roadmap, vello rasterizer plan,
path-(b′) compositor surface API, Serval's `RenderingContextCore` /
`WgpuCapability` seam, and the existing netrender `insert_image_vello`
Path B hook.

This is the first executable lane through G0→G4. It deliberately does
not try to clear full WebGL correctness. The point is to prove the
ownership boundary and texture handoff first, then grow the WebGL state
machine and shader translator behind that boundary.

Status as of 2026-05-11: W0 is repaired locally. W1's Serval-side
adapter crate shell and W2's netrender-side zero-copy composition
receipt are implemented. W3, W4, and the broader W5 gate remain
pending.

### W0. Repair the map

**CLEARED 2026-05-11.** The canonical path-(b′) design note exists at
`2026-05-05_compositor_handoff_path_b_prime.md`; the roadmap, progress
index, vello rasterizer plan, and `netrender_device::compositor` links
all resolve locally.

*Shape:* restore or relocate the referenced
`2026-05-05_compositor_handoff_path_b_prime.md` plan, or update the
roadmap / progress / vello-plan links to the canonical location. The
code already contains the path-(b′) API and receipts; this step keeps
the design map aligned with the shipped API.

*Done condition:* `PROGRESS.md`, the roadmap D3 entry, the vello
rasterizer plan, and `netrender_device::compositor` all link to a file
that exists locally.

### W1. Adapter crate shell and texture contract

**CLEARED 2026-05-11.** Serval now has `servo-webgl-wgpu` under
`components/webgl-wgpu`. It depends on `paint_api`'s `wgpu_backend`
capability and `wgpu`, exposes `WebGlCanvasTexture`, allocates on the
shared device, supports resize and clear, and has a focused
`webgl_canvas_to_netrender_texture_allocates_resizes_and_clears` smoke.

*Shape:* create the sibling WebGL-over-wgpu crate on the Serval/Pelt
side, not in netrender. Preferred first home is `serval/components/`
unless the Pelt integration work needs it under `ports/` temporarily.
The crate exposes a narrow canvas output type, roughly:

```rust
pub struct WebGlCanvasTexture {
  pub texture: wgpu::Texture,
  pub size: (u32, u32),
  pub format: wgpu::TextureFormat,
  pub alpha_mode: CanvasAlphaMode,
  pub generation: u64,
  pub damage: Option<[u32; 4]>,
}
```

The initial texture usage should be at least
`RENDER_ATTACHMENT | TEXTURE_BINDING | COPY_SRC | COPY_DST`, with
`Rgba8Unorm` as the first storage format unless a CTS case proves that
another format must be surfaced earlier.

*Done condition:* a `webgl_canvas_to_netrender_texture` smoke compiles
without `glow`, GLES, EGL, WGL, ANGLE, ServoShell, or surfman
dependencies. The crate can allocate, resize, clear, and expose the
same-device `wgpu::Texture` plus metadata.

### W2. NetRender zero-copy composition smoke

**CLEARED 2026-05-11 on the netrender side.**
`Renderer::compose_external_texture` directly samples a same-device
producer `TextureView` into the already-rendered target. Receipt:
`netrender/tests/pg4_webgl_canvas_texture.rs` creates a producer
texture without `COPY_SRC`, verifies color mapping, and verifies
opacity blending over a vello-rendered scene.

**ORDERED INTERLEAVE FOLLOW-UP CLEARED 2026-05-12.**
`Renderer::render_with_compositor_and_external_textures` now preserves
painter order for external textures that land between ordinary scene
ops. The full ordinary scene renders once into the compositor master,
the external texture composites at its recorded scene-op boundary, and
the ordinary tail that should remain above it is rerendered into a
transparent scratch texture and blended back over the master. Receipt:
`pg4_webgl_canvas_texture_preserves_scene_order`.

*Shape:* prefer the direct same-device external texture pass over
vello's `register_texture` path. `Renderer::insert_image_vello` remains
the compatibility fallback for arbitrary `SceneImage` placement, but
current vello copies registered textures into its image atlas at frame
start and therefore is not the WebGL canvas fast path.

The first zero-copy hook is `Renderer::compose_external_texture`: render
the ordinary vello scene, then sample a producer `TextureView` directly
into the target. The source texture only needs `TEXTURE_BINDING` (plus
whatever the producer needs, e.g. `RENDER_ATTACHMENT` / `COPY_DST`); it
does **not** need `COPY_SRC`. This is ideal for topmost canvas/video
overlays and remains the cheapest G4 receipt. The ordered compositor
path is the next rung above it: call sites record the ordinary scene-op
boundary for each external draw, and NetRender restores painter order
without falling back to the atlas-copy path. The remaining refinement is
cost/shape, not correctness of the first interleaving receipt: repeated
mid-scene externals redraw tails, so a future scene-compositor or true
split-scene implementation can trim redundant work.

*Done condition:* a netrender test creates a producer texture without
`COPY_SRC`, renders ordinary vello content, composites the producer via
the direct external-texture pass, and readback confirms color mapping,
opacity blending, and no CPU readback or texture-copy dependency for
the producer texture.

### W3. Minimal WebGL-shaped render path

**FIRST SERVAL ADAPTER SLICE CLEARED 2026-05-11.**
`components/webgl-wgpu` now has a `WebGlContext` wrapper over the W1
canvas texture with context attributes by construction, default
framebuffer clear/draw/readback, buffer creation/binding/data upload,
vertex attrib reflection/setup including interleaved stride and offset,
reflected `uniform vec4` fragment color setup, one cross-stage `varying
vec4` color path, `drawArrays`, `getError`, `readPixels`, resize, and
context loss / recreation receipts. The first draw path remains
triangle-only on `Rgba8Unorm`.

The archived `webrender_build/src/wgsl.rs` translator source is not in
the current working tree, but it is present at
`origin/wgpu-backend-0.68-minimal:webrender_build/src/wgsl.rs`. The
W3 slice ports the core safety shape from that translator for the
first canonical pair: `components/webgl-wgpu/shader.rs` accepts the
canonical ESSL 1.00 vertex / fragment pair, validates that narrow
receipt independent of comments and whitespace, records `lowp` /
`mediump` / `highp` fragment-float precision for the canonical body,
accepts literal `vec4(r,g,b,a)` fragment colors in the `0.0..1.0`
range, a reflected `uniform vec4` color, or a single linked `varying
vec4` color sourced from a reflected vertex `attribute vec4`. It lowers
those receipts to naga-acceptable GLSL 4.50, runs naga on an 8 MB stack
behind a panic boundary, and returns naga-generated WGSL for
`create_program_from_essl` to pipeline along with tiny reflection
metadata for the canonical `vec2` position attribute at location 0,
optional `vec4` color attribute at location 1, optional fragment-color
uniform, and fragment-float precision. `WebGlContext` caches the
resulting canonical translation by validated shader shape so repeated
program creation does not re-run the naga path and exposes
`get_attrib_location` and `get_uniform_location` from that reflection.
Render pipelines are cached per effective vertex stride and attribute
offset so tightly packed and interleaved vertex buffers use the same
translated program with distinct wgpu vertex layouts. This first receipt
proves the API, layer boundaries, precision/reflection/cache hook, and
safety boundary; it is not general ESSL parsing.
It does **not** port the full ~2K-line WebRender pre-pass / post-pass
translator yet; do not widen shader acceptance beyond that canonical
receipt until the rest of the G2 wrapper is restored/ported behind the
same seam.

*Shape:* implement the smallest WebGL API-shaped object behind the
adapter crate: context attributes, default framebuffer backed by the
canvas texture, `clear`, buffer creation/binding, vertex attrib setup,
`getAttribLocation`, minimal `getUniformLocation` / `uniform4f`,
`drawArrays`, `getError`, `readPixels`, resize, and context loss /
recreation. Keep the first draw path intentionally tiny: triangle only,
RGBA8 target, no extensions, no WebGL 2.

Shader support for this step should enter through the G2 translator
wrapper rather than through a handwritten WGSL-only shortcut. For the
first receipt, accept a tiny set of canonical ESSL 1.00 vertex/fragment
pairs and route them through the panic-caught, 8 MB stack naga wrapper
from the prior WebRender translator work. Full precision propagation
and sampler breadth can follow once the vertical slice renders.

*Done condition:* the adapter renders clear + triangle into its canvas
texture, `readPixels` matches expected RGBA bytes, `getError` reports
the WebGL-mandated errors for at least one invalid bind/draw case, and
the resulting texture still composes through W2's netrender smoke.

### W4. Pelt/Serval integration smoke

**NON-PRESENTING PAINT-PATH RECEIPT CLEARED 2026-05-12.**
`components/paint/tests/webgl_canvas_texture_e2e.rs` now drives a
synthetic `servo-webgl-wgpu` triangle texture through the painter's
external-texture registry, Serval display-list emission,
`Paint::render`, NetRender's ordered compositor handoff, and final
readback. The receipt includes ordinary 2D content both below and above
the canvas so the painter-order contract is exercised end to end.

**PELT NON-PRESENTING HOST SMOKE CLEARED 2026-05-12.**
`cargo run -p pelt -- --webgl-wgpu-smoke` now boots the Pelt desktop
host's NetRender path, produces a real `servo-webgl-wgpu` triangle
texture, composites it between ordinary scene ops through
`render_with_compositor_and_external_textures`, captures the presented
master texture, and asserts the expected green canvas pixel plus the
blue above-canvas overlay pixel. This satisfies the "non-presenting Pelt
smoke" branch of the done condition below; a headed OS-window smoke is
optional follow-on coverage, not the W4 blocker.

*Shape:* wire the adapter into the existing wgpu context path:
`RenderingContextCore::wgpu()` supplies the shared device/queue,
the adapter produces a canvas texture, the paint/composition layer
registers that texture with netrender, and Pelt presents the frame.
If the canvas is also a declared compositor surface, reuse
`CompositorSurface` / `SurfaceKey` metadata rather than inventing a
parallel surface lifecycle.

*Done condition:* a headed or non-presenting Pelt smoke loads a page
or synthetic display list containing one WebGL canvas, presents it via
the netrender path, and captures a screenshot/readback with the WebGL
triangle visibly composited with surrounding 2D content.

### W5. Gates before widening

**FIRST NAMED W5 GATE CLEARED 2026-05-12.**
`webgl_first_gate_triangle_error_resize_receipt` now bundles the first
state-machine gate in one named receipt: invalid draw error generation,
canonical triangle render/readback, and resize/generation advance. The
existing NetRender PG4 and Pelt smoke commands remain the cross-crate
composition and host checks.

Do not start WebGL 2, broad extensions, or the full CTS matrix until
the W1-W4 lane is green. Once it is green, the next lane is the G1/G2
correctness ladder: more API validation, translator precision work,
uniform / attribute linking, samplers, framebuffer completeness, then
small CTS buckets.

The first lane's regression commands should be narrow and named:

```text
cargo test -p servo-webgl-wgpu webgl_first_gate_triangle_error_resize_receipt
cargo test -p servo-webgl-wgpu webgl_context_viewport_and_scissor_clip_draws
cargo test -p servo-webgl-wgpu webgl_context_draws_texture_sampler_fragment
cargo test -p servo-webgl-wgpu webgl_context_sampler_uniform_selects_texture_unit
cargo test -p servo-webgl-wgpu webgl_context_rejects_invalid_texture_unit_state
cargo test -p servo-webgl-wgpu webgl_context_draws_into_texture_framebuffer
cargo test -p servo-webgl-wgpu webgl_context_clears_renderbuffer_framebuffer
cargo test -p servo-webgl-wgpu webgl_context_reports_framebuffer_completeness_status
cargo test -p servo-webgl-wgpu webgl_context_rejects_incomplete_framebuffer_operations
cargo test -p servo-webgl-wgpu webgl_context_explicit_compile_link_pipeline_renders
cargo test -p servo-webgl-wgpu webgl_context_compile_failure_reports_shader_info_log
cargo test -p servo-webgl-wgpu webgl_context_link_failure_reports_program_info_log
cargo test -p servo-webgl-wgpu webgl_canvas_to_netrender_texture
cargo test -p netrender pg4_webgl_canvas_texture
cargo run -p pelt -- --webgl-wgpu-smoke
```

These are now real lane commands: one adapter test, one NetRender
composition test, and one Pelt-owned integration smoke.
