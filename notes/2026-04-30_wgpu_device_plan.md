# wgpu Device Plan — `spirv-shader-pipeline` branch

Date: 2026-04-30
Branch: `spirv-shader-pipeline` (in `mark-ik/webrender-wgpu`, formerly worktree `upstream-wgpu-device`)
Status: planning

## Goal

Add a wgpu-backed `Device` to WebRender that consumes the committed SPIR-V
corpus in `webrender/res/spirv/`, sitting alongside the existing GL device behind
a trait. Reach reftest parity with the GL device, mirroring what
`origin/wgpu-device-renderer-gl-parity` achieved (413/413). Stopgap, not the
long-term renderer — that's netrender on `main` — but built reliably enough to
serve as an oracle for netrender's bind-group / vertex-layout shape.

## Non-goals

- No GLSL→SPIRV compilation at build time. The corpus is committed; regenerate
  manually with `cargo run -p webrender_build --features shader-gen --bin gen_spirv`
  when `webrender/res/*.glsl` changes.
- No SVG filter support in the wgpu device until upstream `cs_svg_filter_node.frag`
  is reworked for Vulkan-GLSL compatibility (one known compile failure deferred).
- No replacement of the GL device on this branch. It stays compilable and
  runnable; switching is a feature flag.
- No upstream PR. Lives in fork.

## Architectural decisions (answered)

### A1. Bind group layouts: wgpu auto-derive + reflection oracle in tests

At runtime, `create_render_pipeline` is called with `layout: None` so wgpu's
internal naga reflects each `ShaderModule(SpirV)` and derives a
`PipelineLayout` automatically. No hand-authored `BindGroupLayoutEntry` tables
required for runtime correctness.

For verifiability, a build-or-test-time tool (`webrender_build` bin
`reflect_spirv`) walks every `.spv` artifact, runs `naga::front::spv` on it,
and emits a golden `bindings.json` (or Rust table) describing each shader's
expected bindings — set, binding index, type, name. Tests assert that the
golden has not drifted vs. fresh reflection. This catches:

- Glslang reassigning binding indices after a shader edit
- Driver/wgpu implementations rejecting auto-derived layouts in non-obvious ways
- Future shader corpus changes silently changing the binding contract

This is option (b) "wgpu auto-derive at runtime" plus (c) "reflected golden as
verification oracle" — not option (c) hand-authored as the prior branches did.

### A2. Coexistence: medium-trait split by concern, sibling impls, feature-gated

Departs from `origin/wgpu-device-renderer-gl-parity`'s 3-method minimal trait
(which forked the renderer above the device, accepting duplicated paths and
drift risk) and from a full 168-method abstraction (which would force one of
GL or wgpu into an unnatural shape). Middle path: split `Device`'s public
surface into a small set of traits scoped by concern. Each trait is
defensible in size, both backends implement each one with natural-shaped
code, and the renderer above the device is generic over trait bounds rather
than feature-gated.

Trait split (names and scope; exact method lists settle in P0):

- **`GpuResources`** — texture/buffer/sampler/FBO/PBO/VAO/VBO ownership and
  upload. Roughly: `create_texture`, `delete_texture`,
  `upload_texture_immediate`, `upload_texture`, `copy_*_texture*`, `create_fbo`,
  `delete_fbo`, `create_pbo`, `create_vao*`, `create_vbo`, `allocate_vbo`,
  `fill_vbo`, `update_vao_*`, `map_pbo_for_readback`, `attach_read_texture*`,
  `invalidate_render_target`, `reuse_render_target`. ~25 methods.
- **`GpuShaders`** — program/pipeline/uniform/binding management.
  `compile_shader`, `create_program*`, `link_program`, `bind_program`,
  `delete_program`, `get_uniform_location`, `set_uniforms`,
  `bind_shader_samplers`, `set_shader_texture_size`. ~10 methods. On wgpu,
  "program" maps to a `RenderPipeline` keyed by (SPIRV module, vertex layout,
  baked state).
- **`GpuFrame`** — frame lifecycle, capabilities, parameters.
  `begin_frame`, `end_frame`, `reset_state`, `get_capabilities`,
  `max_texture_size`, `preferred_color_formats`, `swizzle_settings`,
  `supports_extension`, `set_parameter`, `report_memory`,
  `echo_driver_messages`, the depth/ortho/PBO query getters. ~15 methods.
- **`GpuPass`** — per-pass binding, state, draw, blit, readback.
  `bind_read_target`, `bind_draw_target`, `reset_*_target`,
  `bind_external_draw_target`, `bind_vao`, `bind_custom_vao`, `bind_texture`,
  `bind_external_texture`, `set_blend*`, `set_scissor_rect`,
  `enable/disable_scissor`, `enable/disable_color_write`,
  `enable/disable_depth*`, `disable_stencil`, `set_blend_mode_*`,
  `draw_triangles_*`, `draw_indexed_triangles*`, `draw_nonindexed_*`,
  `blit_render_target*`, `read_pixels*`, `get_tex_image_into`. ~30 methods.

Total: ~80 methods across 4 traits. Down from 168 because GL-internal
helpers (`gl()`, `rc_gl()`, `gl_describe_format`, GL-FBO impl details) stay
on the concrete `GlDevice` and are not exposed to renderer code that wants
to be backend-agnostic.

Where GL and wgpu semantics genuinely diverge — VAO emulation on wgpu
(buffer + layout pair), immediate state vs. baked-into-pipeline state, GL's
`bind_program` vs. wgpu's pipeline-as-state — the trait method's contract is
defined in wgpu-friendly terms (state set declaratively per pass) and the GL
impl adapts using its existing state-tracking machinery.

File layout:

```text
webrender/src/device/
  mod.rs        — declares the four traits + cfg-gated module re-exports
  gl.rs         — existing impl, gated by `feature = "gl_backend"`,
                  implementing all four traits on `GlDevice` (renamed from `Device`)
  wgpu.rs       — new impl, gated by `feature = "wgpu_backend"`
                  (or `wgpu/` subdir if it grows past one file)
  query_gl.rs   — unchanged
```

`webrender/src/renderer/init.rs` keeps two factory functions
(`create_webrender_instance` for GL, `create_webrender_instance_wgpu` for
wgpu) because device construction inputs differ (`Rc<dyn gl::Gl>` vs. wgpu
`Instance + Surface`). Downstream of construction, renderer code is generic
over trait bounds; no per-method feature-gating.

Both backends compile-check together in CI; one is selected at link time.

### A3. Vertex layouts: one mechanical adapter from existing typed schema

WebRender already declares vertex schemas in
`webrender/src/renderer/vertex.rs` and `webrender/src/device/gl.rs` as typed
`VertexDescriptor { vertex_attributes, instance_attributes }` with
`VertexAttribute { name, count, kind, ... }`. We add one adapter:

```rust
// illustrative signature only
fn descriptor_to_wgpu_layouts(
    desc: &VertexDescriptor,
) -> [wgpu::VertexBufferLayout<'static>; 2]; // [vertex, instance]
```

The shaderc generator was invoked with `set_auto_map_locations(true)`, which
assigns `layout(location = N)` to vertex inputs in declaration order matching
the GLSL source. The schemas in WebRender are in the same order. So the adapter
walks the schema, accumulates byte offsets, and emits `wgpu::VertexAttribute {
shader_location: i, offset, format }` per entry. No string parsing, no regex,
no WGSL inspection.

The reflection oracle from A1 also captures vertex input locations, so the
adapter's output is asserted against reflection in tests.

## Phase breakdown

Each phase has explicit done conditions. Phases are sequential except where
noted.

### P0 — Trait split + GL impl behind feature

Substantive — defines the trait surface that everything else extends.

Done when:

- `pub trait GpuResources`, `GpuShaders`, `GpuFrame`, `GpuPass` declared in
  `webrender/src/device/mod.rs` with full method signatures
- Existing GL `Device` (renamed `GlDevice`) moves behind
  `#[cfg(feature = "gl_backend")]` and implements all four traits
- Renderer code that previously called `device.foo()` against the concrete
  `Device` continues to compile, now against trait bounds
- `cargo build -p webrender --features gl_backend` clean
- Existing reftests pass under `gl_backend` (no behavioral change)
- No wgpu code yet

Method assignment to traits is finalized in this phase. Reference
`origin/wgpu-device-renderer-gl-parity:webrender/src/device/mod.rs` for what
the renderer above the device actually needs from each concern, but expand
the trait coverage beyond their 3-method minimum.

### P1 — Skeleton wgpu device

Done when (closed 2026-05-01):

- ✅ `webrender/src/device/wgpu.rs` exists with `WgpuDevice` struct implementing
  all four traits — methods may be `unimplemented!()` but signatures match
- ✅ `wgpu` dep added to `webrender/Cargo.toml` under `[features] wgpu_backend`
- ⚠️ `cargo build -p webrender --features wgpu_backend` clean — **deferred**
- ✅ Construction wires an `Adapter`, `Device`, `Queue`, surface format
- ✅ `cargo build -p webrender --features "gl_backend wgpu_backend"` clean
  (both backends compile together; one selected at link time later)

The `--features wgpu_backend` (alone) target is deferred until renderer code
becomes generic over the trait bounds. As of P1 close, renderer code uses
the concrete `Device` (= `GlDevice`) type pervasively across ~9000 lines in
`renderer/`, `screen_capture.rs`, `compositor/sw_compositor.rs`. Cfg-gating
those out would compile but produce a library with `WgpuDevice` and no
renderer — not useful. Revisit when renderer-genericization happens (P5+).

Side achievements of the P1 lift work: `device/types.rs` now holds 14
backend-neutral types (lifted from `gl.rs`); `traits.rs` imports nothing
from `super::gl`; the trait surface is fully implementation-agnostic.

### P2 — SPIRV loading + reflection oracle

Done when (closed 2026-05-01):

- ✅ `webrender_build` gains a `reflect_spirv` binary that emits
  `webrender/res/spirv/bindings.json` from the committed `.spv` files
- ✅ The output is committed; oracle test asserts it's regenerable
  byte-identical (`webrender_build/tests/spirv_bindings_oracle.rs`)
- ✅ `WgpuDevice` loads `.spv` via `create_shader_module_from_spv`,
  creates `wgpu::ShaderModule` via `wgpu::ShaderSource::SpirV`
- ✅ Smallest shader (`ps_clear`) creates a `RenderPipeline` with
  `layout: None` (`webrender/tests/wgpu_pipeline_smoke.rs`)
- ✅ The smoke test confirms wgpu's internal naga successfully reflects
  ps_clear's SPIR-V; transitively, the auto-derived layout matches the
  golden because both sides invoke the same naga 26.0 crate

Two known limitations carried forward (see Known Issues #6, #7).

### P3 — Vertex schema adapter

Done when (closed 2026-05-01):

- ✅ `descriptor_to_wgpu_layouts(...)` exists in `webrender/src/device/wgpu.rs`
  (associated function on `WgpuDevice`; returns `WgpuVertexLayouts` which
  owns the attribute `Vec`s)
- ⚠️ Unit tests cover **representative** `VertexDescriptor`s (ps_clear +
  3 synthetic) rather than every descriptor in the codebase — per-descriptor
  coverage rolls in incrementally as P7 wires shaders through. The
  conversion logic itself is fully unit-tested.
- ✅ Test asserts adapter output `shader_location` indices match the
  bindings.json reflection oracle for ps_clear (locations 0, 1, 2).

### P4 — Resource model: textures, buffers, samplers

Done when:
- `WgpuDevice` implements texture create/upload/bind paths through the trait
- A textured pipeline (`ps_quad_textured` is the smallest) constructs without
  panic
- Buffer upload paths (vertex, instance, index, uniform/UBO) implemented
- Sampler creation honours WebRender's existing sampler request enum

Reference: `origin/wgpu-device-sharing` shows the resource model that landed
parity. Borrow texture descriptor mapping; do not borrow the WGSL string parser.

### P5 — Frame submission

Done when:
- `WgpuDevice` builds and submits a `CommandEncoder` per frame
- Render passes correctly bind pipelines, vertex/instance buffers, bind groups,
  and issue `draw_indexed` mirroring GL device call sites
- `begin_frame` / `end_frame` symmetry preserved across the trait

### P6 — First shader end-to-end

Done when:
- `wrench` (or a minimal smoke test) renders a frame whose only draw is
  `ps_clear` through the wgpu device, output pixels match GL device output
  within 1 ULP
- Re-run with `ps_quad_textured` against a single sampled texture, same parity

This phase is the integration moment; expect to discover gaps in P0-P5 and
loop back. Build hard parity tests here so later shaders inherit them.

### P7 — Shader-by-shader expansion

Done when:
- All committed SPIRV variants (excluding `cs_svg_filter_node`) instantiate
  pipelines without errors and run their corresponding render paths
- Per-shader smoke test confirms each issues correct draws

Order suggestion (cheapest first): `ps_clear`, `ps_copy`, `ps_quad_*`,
`brush_solid`, `brush_blend`, `brush_image` family, `cs_blur`, `cs_scale`,
`cs_border_*`, `cs_line_decoration`, `composite`, `ps_text_run`,
`brush_yuv_image`, the rest.

### P8 — Reftest parity push

Done when:
- Full WebRender reftest suite runs under wgpu backend
- Failures triaged into: (a) parity bugs to fix, (b) GLSL/SPIRV
  precision/rounding differences within reasonable tolerance, (c) genuinely
  blocked (e.g. SVG filters)
- Target: match `origin/wgpu-device-renderer-gl-parity`'s 413/413 minus the
  SVG-filter cohort

## Known issues carried into this plan

1. **`cs_svg_filter_node.frag` does not compile to SPIRV.** Combined-sampler
   syntax incompatible with Vulkan GLSL at line 1544 of the assembled shader.
   Vertex stage compiles fine. Plan: defer; SVG filter effects through wgpu
   device fall back to GL device or are unsupported on this branch. Re-address
   if reftest parity push surfaces it as gating.

2. **Binding indices may shift if shaders are regenerated.** glslang's
   `set_auto_bind_uniforms` assigns indices based on declaration order. A
   shader edit that reorders uniforms changes the contract. The reflection
   oracle (A1) catches this; treat any oracle diff in PR review as a renderer
   binding contract change, not a shader-only change.

3. **wgpu's auto-derived layouts may be too permissive or strict.** If we
   discover wgpu auto-derives layouts that the renderer can't bind against
   (e.g. expects a sampler we never bind, or splits a UBO across sets in an
   inconvenient way), we fall back to hand-authored layouts seeded by the
   reflection oracle output. A1's oracle is the bridge: the same JSON could
   build a `Vec<BindGroupLayout>` programmatically.

4. **`Capabilities` struct is GL-flavored.** Lifted to
   `device/types.rs` in P1d as pure data (24 fields: mostly `bool`, one
   `Option<bool>`, one `String`), but the field names reflect GL extensions
   (`supports_advanced_blend_equation`, `supports_qcom_tiled_rendering`,
   `requires_vao_rebind_after_orphaning`, etc.). The wgpu impl will set
   most fields to `false` and never use them. Could be refactored into a
   smaller backend-neutral struct (e.g. just the flags both backends
   actually consult), but doing so churns the renderer's
   capability-checking call sites. Defer until parity push (P8) reveals
   the actual minimum set the renderer cares about.

5. **wgpu-only build mode (`--no-default-features --features
   wgpu_backend`) is not a P1 goal.** The plan's compile target for P1 is
   `--features "gl_backend wgpu_backend"` (both backends together). The
   wgpu-only path requires either pervasive cfg-gating of every gleam
   usage in renderer files (`renderer/mod.rs`, `renderer/shade.rs`,
   `screen_capture.rs`, `compositor/sw_compositor.rs`) or making `gleam`
   a non-optional dep that's ignored when gl_backend is off. Neither is
   meaningfully cleaner; defer the decision until the wgpu impl actually
   demonstrates value standalone (likely P6+).

6. **Naga reflection coverage is partial: 22/125 SPIR-V stages
   reflect cleanly.** The remaining 103 stages fall into two cohorts:

   - 28 stages fail on `naga: UnsupportedCapability(SampledRect)` — these
     are the `TEXTURE_RECT` shader variants. `GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE` is
     fundamentally GL-only with no wgpu equivalent, so these stages are
     correctly excluded from any wgpu use. No action needed; document
     that the wgpu device skips `_TEXTURE_RECT` variants.
   - 75 stages fail on `naga: InvalidId(N)` — naga's SPIR-V parser
     rejecting constructs in our corpus. Pattern: shaders that *use*
     samplers (call `texture(...)`) fail; shaders that only *declare*
     samplers but don't sample them (e.g. `_DEBUG_OVERDRAW` variants,
     which output a debug color) reflect fine. Suggests the issue is in
     OpSampledImage / texture-sampling instruction parsing, not in the
     resource declarations themselves.

   **Negative results recorded (2026-05-01 / 2026-05-02):**
   - `opts.set_auto_combined_image_sampler(true)` in `gen_spirv.rs`: zero
     effect on SPIR-V output (byte-identical). When the GLSL already uses
     combined `sampler2D` types, glslang's Vulkan target produces
     combined-sampler SPIR-V regardless. Option only matters for HLSL or
     separate `texture2D`/`sampler` GLSL.
   - **Naga version spike (26 → 27 → 29; 28 skipped due to Windows backend
     bugs)**: zero change in reflection coverage. naga 26, 27, and 29 all
     produce byte-identical reflection output and the EXACT same error
     distribution (28 `SampledRect`, 75 `InvalidId(N)`). Definitively
     ruled out: naga version-pinning is not the issue.

   **Root cause identified (2026-05-02 SPIR-V probe):**
   `webrender_build/src/bin/probe_spv.rs` walks the SPIR-V bytes around
   the failing IDs. For ps_quad_textured.frag, ID 153 is defined by
   `OpLoad` of an `OpTypeSampledImage`-typed variable, then used directly
   as the Sampled Image operand of `OpImageSampleImplicitLod`.

   This is **Pattern B (combined samplers)** of two valid Vulkan SPIR-V
   patterns for texture sampling:
   - **Pattern A (separated):** `OpLoad image` + `OpLoad sampler` +
     `OpSampledImage(image, sampler)` → used by `OpImageSample*`. Produced
     by GLSL declarations like `uniform texture2D t; uniform sampler s;`.
   - **Pattern B (combined):** `OpLoad sampledImage` → used directly by
     `OpImageSample*`. Produced by GLSL `uniform sampler2D s;` (the
     legacy GL idiom that glslang's Vulkan target preserves).

   Naga's parser only supports Pattern A. Its `lookup_sampled_image`
   map (in `naga/src/front/spv/image.rs`) is populated only by
   `OpSampledImage`; `parse_image_sample` looks up the sample's source
   ID in this map, returning `InvalidId` when it's not there because
   the source was an `OpLoad` instead.

   This is a **genuine naga limitation**, not a glslang or
   webrender-shader bug. WebRender's GLSL using `sampler2D` is
   conventional and produces conforming Vulkan SPIR-V.

   **Three actionable paths (in priority order for upstream-scout
   framing):**
   - **File naga upstream issue with a minimal Pattern B repro.** This
     is the right action for the ecosystem and what #37149 devs would
     do. Expected outcome: naga gains support for `OpLoad` of
     `OpTypeSampledImage` in a future release; we benefit transparently.
   - **`spirv-opt` transform to convert Pattern B → Pattern A.** The
     SPIR-V optimizer has passes that can decompose combined samplers
     into separate image+sampler+OpSampledImage. Would let us regenerate
     the corpus through gen_spirv → spirv-opt → committed `.spv` and
     unblock immediately while waiting on naga upstream fix.
   - **Use `Features::EXPERIMENTAL_PASSTHROUGH_SHADERS`** as last resort.
     Bypasses naga; needs hand-authored bind group layouts. Reverts to
     A1's option (c) which we explicitly architected against.

7. **`set_auto_bind_uniforms` may not be assigning distinct bindings to
   all sampler uniforms.** Suspected by inspection of `bindings.json` —
   need to verify with `spirv-dis` against a shader like
   `brush_blend_DEBUG_OVERDRAW.frag.spv`. If confirmed, the gen_spirv
   fix likely belongs in `webrender_build/src/bin/gen_spirv.rs` (set
   additional shaderc options or explicit binding hints). After fix,
   regenerate the SPIRV corpus, re-run `reflect_spirv`, and re-commit
   `bindings.json`. Coupled with #6 — fixing the binding distribution
   may also address some `InvalidId` failures.

## Verification posture

- Reflection oracle JSON committed; CI re-derives and diffs.
- Vertex-layout adapter unit-tested per descriptor.
- Per-shader pipeline-creation smoke test.
- End-to-end frame parity test for at least 2 shaders before P6 closes.
- Reftest run is the parity gate (P8).

## Oracle-for-netrender notes

If this branch reaches P8 with the reflection oracle and adapter intact, it
produces three things netrender can borrow without binding to the GL corpus:

1. `bindings.json` — set/binding/type per shader, ground truth for what
   WebRender's renderer code actually expects to bind.
2. `descriptor_to_wgpu_layouts` output — the canonical mapping from
   WebRender's typed vertex schema to wgpu vertex layouts.
3. Reftest behaviours per shader — netrender's WGSL implementations can be
   diffed against this branch's output as a known-good reference.

This is opportunistic, not load-bearing. Netrender does not depend on this
branch reaching parity.

## Out of scope, deliberately

- Rewriting any GL-device internals beyond what trait extraction requires.
- Performance work (matching wgpu throughput to GL is a P9 question, not on
  this plan).
- Multi-threaded command encoding.
- WGSL conversion paths (we have SPIRV; we don't need WGSL).
- Touching netrender on `main`.
