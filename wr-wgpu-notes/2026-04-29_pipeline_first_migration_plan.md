# Pipeline-First wgpu Migration Plan (2026-04-29)

**Status**: Active — supersedes the
[2026-04-28 renderer-body wgpu adapter plan](2026-04-28_renderer_body_wgpu_adapter_plan.md).

**Lane**: Replace WebRender's GL backend with an idiomatic wgpu / WGSL
backend, end-to-end. No GL-shaped types preserved as wgpu wrappers. No
second wgpu boot. No data-as-texture carryover. Renderer-body migration
sequenced one shader family at a time, with each slice producing a real
wgpu-native rendering operation through the renderer body.

## 1. Why this supersedes the prior adapter plan

The 2026-04-28 adapter plan ordered migration A2 (textures) → A3
(vertex / buffer) → A4 (shader / pipeline) → … → A8 (re-export flip).
That ordering carried two GL-era assumptions:

1. **Textures-first treats data as the unit.** wgpu does not migrate
   textures in isolation — a texture only matters as an input to a
   pipeline's bind group. Migrating
   `dither_matrix_texture: Option<Texture>` →
   `Option<WgpuTexture>` would have preserved the GL anti-pattern of
   using a 2D texture as a 64-byte data carrier (parent plan §4.6
   forbids this for shared tables; dither is the same shape). The
   fully idiomatic dither shape is a WGSL `const` inline in the
   consuming shaders.
2. **A2.X "first per-pass callsite migration" was a fiction.** Every
   renderer pass-encoding callsite touches a `Texture`, a `Program`,
   and a render target — you can't migrate one without the others.
   Trying to find a "narrowest first callsite" forces either
   parallel wgpu-native plumbing for one path or a `Texture` /
   `DrawTarget` dual-handle bridge, both of which are shims.

The adapter plan also let A2.X.5 install a `WgpuDevice` on `Renderer`
via an internal `WgpuDevice::boot()`, separate from the embedder's
wgpu device. Two adapter selections, two devices, no shared textures,
no possible `ExternalTexture` integration — exactly the kind of
"wgpu-shaped GL" the parent plan §5 forbids. Commit `ad655dc09` is
reverted (`40661cd22`); the reverted state is preserved in branch
history as a documented misstep.

This plan reorders around shader families. Each slice migrates one
family end-to-end with all of its inputs (textures, buffers, bindings,
pipeline, pass encoding) reshaped to their idiomatic wgpu form
together. The renderer's main draw loop dispatches per-family between
GL (unmigrated) and wgpu (migrated) during transition; once every
family migrates, GL deletion follows.

---

## 2. What survives from prior work

A1 / A2.X.0–4 / A2.3.0 work from the superseded adapter plan survives
intact. The wgpu module landed there is the foundation this plan
builds on.

| Module | Prior status | Role under pipeline-first |
|---|---|---|
| `device/wgpu/core.rs` | A1 ✅ | `boot()` becomes a test-only helper; production uses `with_external(handles)` introduced in P0. `REQUIRED_FEATURES` constant unchanged. |
| `device/wgpu/pass.rs` | A2.X.0–2 ✅ | `DrawIntent`, `RenderPassTarget`, `ColorAttachment`, `DepthAttachment`, `flush_pass`. Idiomatic; unchanged. |
| `device/wgpu/frame.rs` | A2.X.4 ✅ | `create_encoder` / `submit`. Unchanged. |
| `device/wgpu/pipeline.rs` | S2 ✅ | `build_brush_solid` is the P1 pilot's pipeline. Other family `build_*` factories land per P slice. |
| `device/wgpu/buffer.rs` | S2 ✅ | Uniform arena + storage-buffer creator. Used by P1+. |
| `device/wgpu/binding.rs` | S2 ✅ | `brush_solid_bind_group` is the P1 pilot's bind-group factory. Sampler cache lands in P2. |
| `device/wgpu/texture.rs` | A2.0 ✅ | `WgpuTexture` for legitimately texture-shaped inputs (image cache, glyph atlas, render targets). Not used for data carriers. |
| `device/wgpu/format.rs` | A2.1.0 ✅ | Format mappings for legit textures. |
| `device/wgpu/readback.rs` | A2.3.0 ✅ | RGBA8 readback for the oracle harness; eventually for renderer `read_pixels`. |
| `device/wgpu/adapter.rs` | A1 ✅ | `WgpuDevice` shape; `boot()` swaps to `with_external(handles)` in P0. |
| `device/wgpu/shaders/brush_solid.wgsl` | S2 ✅ | The P1 pilot's WGSL. |

Seven wgpu device-side tests remain green and are the receipt that
A1 / A2.X foundational machinery is wgpu-correct.

---

## 3. What gets deleted (no wgpu wrapper struct)

These GL-shaped concepts have no wgpu equivalent and do not get a
`WgpuFoo` replacement. They disappear when their users migrate.

- **`VAO`** — wgpu sets vertex buffers per-pass via
  `RenderPass::set_vertex_buffer`; no VAO concept.
- **`VBOId` / `RBOId` / `FBOId`** — wgpu has no GL-handle types.
  Buffers are `wgpu::Buffer`; textures are `wgpu::Texture` /
  `TextureView`; framebuffers are an emergent property of
  `BeginRenderPass`.
- **`UploadPBOPool` / `UploadMethod`** — `wgpu::Queue::write_texture`
  is async-by-default and batched at the driver level.
- **`Program` / `ProgramBinary` / `ProgramCache` /
  `ProgramCacheObserver`** — replaced by `wgpu::RenderPipeline`
  (per-family) plus `wgpu::PipelineCache` (parent §4.11). No
  webrender-specific binary blob format.
- **`get_unoptimized_shader_source` and `webrender/res/*.glsl`** —
  WGSL is authored under `device/wgpu/shaders/`.
- **`get_gl_target`** — wgpu textures carry their dimension via
  descriptor.
- **GL `Capabilities`** — replaced by `wgpu::Features` +
  `wgpu::Limits`, declared in `core::REQUIRED_FEATURES`.
- **Y-flip ortho carry** — wgpu surface orientation is explicit;
  declare it.
- **CPU-side channel swaps, manual blend tables, fixed-function
  emulation** — anti-patterns from the dual-servo era.
- **`bind_program` / `bind_texture` / `set_uniform` mutable per-call
  binding state** — pipelines bind once per render pass; per-draw
  differences come from dynamic offsets (`set_bind_group(offset)`)
  or push constants (`set_immediates`).

## 4. What gets reshaped (data carriers → idiomatic wgpu)

These are GL-era data-as-texture patterns. They get *deleted in their
texture form* and *recreated* in their idiomatic wgpu shape — typically
a storage buffer per parent plan §4.6, sometimes a WGSL `const`. The
migration happens with the consumer slice, not as a standalone "data
lifecycle migration."

| Today (GL) | Tomorrow (wgpu) | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `gpu_buffer_texture_f` (RGBA32F 2D) | `wgpu::Buffer` storage, `read_only: true` | Per-frame structured table; direct random access via index. |
| `gpu_buffer_texture_i` (RGBA32I 2D) | storage buffer | Same shape as above. |
| `transforms_texture` | storage buffer | Per-primitive transforms; indexed per draw. |
| `prim_header_texture` | storage buffer | Per-primitive metadata; indexed per draw. |
| `vertex_data_textures` (`Vec<VertexDataTextures>`, triple-buffered) | storage buffers | Triple-buffer becomes wgpu submit-boundary semantics; explicit. |
| `dither_matrix_texture` (8×8 R8) | WGSL `const DITHER` inline in consuming shaders | 64 bytes — too small to be a binding. |
| `gpu_cache_texture` (paged 2D) | one or more `wgpu::Buffer` storage entries | Existing paging logic carries forward; only the access path changes. Respect `max_storage_buffer_binding_size` (typ. 128 MB portable). |

`gpu_cache` may need multiple storage bindings if the working set
exceeds a single buffer's portable size limit; that decision is
sized at P1 entry (§10 Q2).

---

## 5. What stays texture-shaped

These are genuine images / framebuffer surfaces. They migrate as
`wgpu::Texture` and live in `device/wgpu/texture.rs`'s purview.

- **Texture cache** (`texture_resolver.texture_cache_map`): image
  cache, glyph atlas, picture-cache tiles, standalone textures.
  Sampled in shaders.
- **Render-target attachments**: color and depth attachments produced
  by `RenderTaskGraph` passes; carried as `wgpu::TextureView`.
- **Zoom-debug widget**: a rendered widget bitmap.
- **External textures**: embedder-supplied `wgpu::TextureView` via
  servo-wgpu's `WgpuRenderingContext`-style handoff. No separate
  type — just a view from the embedder's wgpu device, valid because
  the embedder's device is *the same* wgpu device the renderer holds
  (P0 handoff).

---

## 6. Slice plan

Each slice produces a real artifact and is independently reviewable.
P0 is gating; P1..P8 each migrate one shader family end-to-end; D
deletes GL.

### P0 — Embedder wgpu handoff

**Done condition** (✅ landed 2026-04-29 webrender side; servo-wgpu
side outstanding):

- [x] New `WgpuHandles` struct in `device::wgpu::core` carrying
  `wgpu::Instance` / `Adapter` / `Device` / `Queue` by value. wgpu 29
  handle types are `Clone` (Arc-wrapped internally), so the bundle
  is itself `#[derive(Clone)]` — passing by value is four cheap Arc
  bumps. Renamed the prior `core::Device` shape to `WgpuHandles` in
  the same change (clearer boundary against `WgpuDevice` and resolves
  the parent §10 Q1 shadow concern at the type level).
- [x] `WgpuDevice::with_external(handles: WgpuHandles) -> Result<Self,
  wgpu::Features>` replaces internal-boot for production. Returns the
  missing-features set on adapter mismatch so the embedder can decide
  fallback / retry / surface. `core::boot()` and `WgpuDevice::boot()`
  both gated behind `#[cfg(test)]`.
- [x] `core::REQUIRED_FEATURES` check runs against the embedder's
  adapter at `with_external(...)`; mismatch surfaces as
  `RendererError::WgpuFeaturesMissing(::wgpu::Features)` (the
  absolute-path `::wgpu` is intentional — defends against the local
  `wgpu` module shadow).
- [x] `create_webrender_instance(gl, wgpu: WgpuHandles, notifier,
  options, shaders)` — new `wgpu` parameter as the second positional
  argument. GL parameter remains during transition.
- [x] `Renderer.wgpu_device: WgpuDevice` field installed correctly
  (this time via the embedder handoff, not via an internal boot —
  the misstep the A2.X.5 revert documented).
- [ ] **Servo-wgpu's call site update** is the outstanding piece.
  Pre-P0 tag `pre-p0` (at `aa1850ed7`) marks the last
  `create_webrender_instance(gl, notifier, options, shaders)`
  signature; servo-wgpu can pin against it until its compositor
  hands its `wgpu::Device` / `Queue` through to webrender. Tracked
  outside this repo.

Receipt: `cargo check -p webrender` green (7 warnings, all
unused-helper warnings on adapter machinery awaiting P1 callers);
seven device-side wgpu tests pass via `WgpuDevice::boot()` (the
`#[cfg(test)]` shortcut) in 1.93s. Tests now exercise the
`with_external` path implicitly via the renamed `WgpuHandles` /
`WgpuDevice::boot()` (which constructs a `WgpuDevice` from `boot()`'s
`WgpuHandles` — same shape as the production handoff).

**Sequenced finding during P0**:

- The `use super::core::{self, ...}` import in `adapter.rs` had to
  split into two: `use super::core::{REQUIRED_FEATURES, WgpuHandles};`
  unconditionally, plus `#[cfg(test)] use super::core;` for the
  test-only `boot()` method's references to `core::BootError` /
  `core::boot()`. Without the split, the unconditional `self` was
  unused in non-test compilation.
- `Renderer.wgpu_device` is `pub` (matches the GL `pub device:
  Device` next to it) so embedder code that already reaches into
  `renderer.device.*` can reach `renderer.wgpu_device.*` symmetrically
  during the transition. P slices may tighten visibility once
  callsites stabilise.

### P1 — `brush_solid` end-to-end pilot

**Done condition**: `brush_solid` primitives render correctly through
the actual renderer body via wgpu; pixel-diff against a captured
oracle within tolerance.

This is the largest single slice in the plan and lands as a sequence
of sub-slices, each independently committed. P1 closes when every
sub-slice has landed and the oracle-match receipt passes.

#### Sub-slices (planned)

- [x] **P1.1 — Production-shape storage buffers in brush_solid smoke
  (2026-04-29).** Replaced the S2 contrived palette/push-constant
  shape with two production-shape storage buffers: `PrimitiveHeader`
  (mirrors `prim_shared.glsl::PrimitiveHeader` collapsed into a
  single 64-byte std430 struct — parent §4.6) and `gpu_buffer_f`
  (mirrors GL `fetch_from_gpu_buffer_*`, `vec4<f32>` array indexed by
  `header.specific_prim_address`). brush_solid now fetches its
  header by `instance_index` and reads its colour via
  `gpu_buffer_f[header.specific_prim_address]`, the same shape
  production will use. The `ALPHA_PASS` WGSL `override` replaces
  `MAX_PALETTE_ENTRIES` as the demo of §4.9 specialisation.
  `DrawIntent::uniform_offset` (a single `u32`) became
  `dynamic_offsets: Vec<u32>` to support bind groups with no
  dynamic-offset entries (the new layout has none). `render_rect_smoke`
  exercises the new path; remaining 6 wgpu tests untouched. **Not
  yet wired**: `Transform`, `PictureTask`, `ClipArea`, per-instance
  vertex attributes (`aData`), draw-loop dispatch in renderer body —
  P1.2 onward.
- [ ] **P1.2 — Transform storage buffer.** `brush_solid` reads
  `header.transform_id` to fetch a 4×4 matrix; vertex shader applies
  it. Smoke renders a non-identity-transformed quad to validate.
- [ ] **P1.3 — Per-instance vertex attributes.** Replace
  `instance_index → header_index` with the GL-shaped `aData ivec4`
  vertex stream, so multiple primitives can ride one draw call.
- [ ] **P1.4 — PictureTask + render-target attachment.** Read
  `header.picture_task_address` for content_origin / device pixel
  scale; first wgpu-native render target lifecycle in the renderer.
- [ ] **P1.5 — ClipArea + alpha-pass override variant.** Both
  pipeline cache entries (opaque + alpha) fully wired; `ALPHA_PASS`
  override does real work.
- [ ] **P1.6 — Per-family draw-loop dispatch.** First renderer-body
  edit: `draw_alpha_batch_container` recognises
  `BrushBatchKind::Solid` and routes to wgpu via
  `self.wgpu_device.encode_pass`. Other families fall through to
  GL.
- [ ] **P1.7 — Pipeline cache (§4.11).** `wgpu::PipelineCache` with
  on-disk path; async compile.
- [ ] **P1.8 — Authored brush_solid-only oracle scene + capture.**
  Extends `webrender/tests/oracle/` via the
  `webrender-wgpu-oracle` worktree.
- [ ] **P1.9 — End-to-end test: oracle\_brush\_solid\_smoke
  matches.** Closes P1.

#### What lands across the sub-slices

- [ ] **Storage-buffer reshape** of `gpu_cache`, `transforms`,
  `prim_headers` for `brush_solid`'s consumption. The 2D-texture
  forms remain populated for unmigrated families until D; this slice
  adds parallel storage-buffer producers fed by the same backend
  data.
- [ ] **§4.7 uniform hierarchy** wired in production: dynamic-offset
  uniform buffer for per-draw transforms; push constants
  (`var<immediate>`) for per-draw flags / indices; static uniform
  for per-pass viewport / time.
- [ ] **§4.8 record-then-flush** in the renderer body: the
  `brush_solid` path's draw call becomes a `DrawIntent` recorded
  into a per-pass bucket; pass replay through
  `WgpuDevice::encode_pass`.
- [ ] **§4.9 override specialization**: `brush_solid` alpha vs.
  opaque variants collapse to one WGSL plus override-specialized
  pipelines (the override pattern from S2 already works for
  `MAX_PALETTE_ENTRIES`; widen to alpha-mode here).
- [ ] **§4.11 async pipeline compile + on-disk cache** introduced
  for the `brush_solid` pipeline; `wgpu::PipelineCache` gets its
  on-disk path. Warming UX deferred to compositor integration but
  the cache mechanic lands here.
- [ ] **Render-target attachment**: one `wgpu::Texture` /
  `wgpu::TextureView` for `brush_solid`'s output, attached via
  `RenderPassTarget`. Render-target lifecycle (size, recreation on
  resize) lands here.
- [ ] **Per-family draw-loop dispatch**: the renderer's main draw
  loop recognizes `brush_solid` batches and routes them through
  wgpu; other families fall through to GL during transition. Single
  `match` in the draw loop — not a trait, not a compatibility shim.
  Annotated with a TODO marker so all migration sites grep
  (§10 Q1).

Receipt: a `brush_solid`-only oracle scene (e.g., an authored solid-
rectangle YAML rendered through Wrench → captured PNG) pixel-matches
through the renderer body's wgpu path. Tolerance default 0;
documented per-scene tolerance only on root cause (parent §S4
"No hacks"). Test name: `renderer::wgpu_brush_solid_smoke` or
similar; runs as part of `cargo test -p webrender`.

### P2 — Brush family expansion

**Done condition**: `brush_image`, `brush_image_repeat`,
`brush_blend`, `brush_mix_blend`, `brush_linear_gradient`,
`brush_opacity`, `brush_yuv_image` migrate through the same
pipeline-first pattern P1 established.

What lands beyond P1:

- [ ] **Sampled texture machinery**: `wgpu::Texture` +
  `wgpu::Sampler` + bind-group entries for image-cache textures.
- [ ] **Sampler cache** in `WgpuDevice` (same
  `Mutex<HashMap>::entry().or_insert_with()` pattern as the brush
  pipeline cache).
- [ ] **Texture-cache integration**: `texture_resolver.
  texture_cache_map` entries become `wgpu::Texture` for image-cache,
  picture-cache tile, atlas, and standalone categories.
- [ ] **YUV / blend-mode / opacity variants** through override
  specialization where parameter-only.

Receipt: brush-family oracle scenes match. The texture cache entries
consumed by migrated families no longer back to GL textures.

### P3 — `ps_quad` family

**Done condition**: textured / gradient / radial / conic / mask /
mask-fast-path quad shaders migrate.

What lands beyond P2:

- [ ] More override specialization cases (gradient interpolation
  modes, mask vs. mask-fast-path).
- [ ] First time a single pipeline family handles multiple primitive
  types via overrides.

### P4 — Clip-mask family (`cs_clip_*`)

**Done condition**: `cs_clip_rectangle` (incl. fast path) and
`cs_clip_box_shadow` migrate.

What lands beyond P3:

- [ ] **First cache-task render pass**: clip masks render to
  dedicated render-target textures used as inputs to subsequent
  draws. Demonstrates multi-pass orchestration via
  `RenderTaskGraph` + `encode_pass` per pass.
- [ ] **Depth attachment policy** exercised under realistic load
  (clear / discard via `RenderPassTarget`).

### P5 — Cache-task family (gradient / blur / scale / svg-filter)

**Done condition**: `cs_fast_linear_gradient`, `cs_linear_gradient`,
`cs_radial_gradient`, `cs_conic_gradient`, `cs_blur` (color + alpha),
`cs_scale`, `cs_svg_filter`, `cs_svg_filter_node` migrate.

### P6 — Border / line cache tasks

**Done condition**: `cs_border_solid`, `cs_border_segment`,
`cs_line_decoration` migrate.

### P7 — Text family

**Done condition**: `ps_text_run` + dual-source variants migrate.
Glyph atlas becomes a `wgpu::Texture` (or texture array per
parent §S6 sub-task; parent §Q14 atlas-ownership stays as resolved).

What lands beyond P6:

- [ ] **Glyph atlas as `wgpu::Texture`** — the genuine-texture case;
  no reshape to buffer.
- [ ] **Dual-source blending** verified at runtime via subpixel-AA
  test scene.

### P8 — Composite / debug / utility

**Done condition**: `composite` (incl. fast path + yuv variants),
`debug_color`, `debug_font`, `ps_clear`, `ps_copy` migrate.

After P8, every shader family in `WgpuShaderVariant::ALL`
(parent §S6) renders through wgpu. The renderer's draw loop has
only the wgpu branch reached at runtime, even though the GL branch
still compiles.

### D — Delete GL backend

**Done condition**: `cargo build` is GL-free.
`cargo tree | grep -i gl` returns nothing surprising. The binary
works in servo-wgpu.

Checklist:

- [ ] Delete `webrender/src/device/gl.rs`, `query_gl.rs`.
- [ ] Drop `gleam` dep from `webrender/Cargo.toml`.
- [ ] Delete authored GLSL: `webrender/res/*.glsl`.
- [ ] Delete `swgl/`, `glsl-to-cxx/`.
- [ ] Delete `webrender_build/src/glsl.rs`,
  `webrender_build/src/wgsl.rs` if any, and any
  `shader_runtime_contract*` content.
- [ ] Delete `dither_matrix_texture`, `gpu_buffer_texture_f/i`,
  `vertex_data_textures`, `transforms_texture`, `prim_header_texture`
  from `Renderer`. (The data is still produced — into storage
  buffers — but the texture-shaped fields go.)
- [ ] Delete VAO / VBO / PBO / FBO / `Program` / `ProgramCache` /
  `Capabilities` infrastructure.
- [ ] Delete `Renderer::device: Device` (the GL one). The wgpu
  handles become the only GPU surface.
- [ ] `gl: Rc<dyn gl::Gl>` parameter to `create_webrender_instance`
  deleted.
- [ ] Per-family draw-loop dispatch collapses to a single wgpu path.
- [ ] Servo-wgpu drops its GL dep.

Receipt: parent plan §S4 oracle scenes all pass through the wgpu
path; `cargo build -p webrender` clean; binary works in servo-wgpu.

## 7. Sequencing

Hard dependencies:

- P0 → everything (need embedder handoff before any family-side
  work)
- P1 → P2..P8 (need the pilot's pattern before extending)
- P2 → P3..P7 (need sampled-texture machinery)
- P4 → P5, P6 (need cache-task pass shape)
- D → all P slices (need every family migrated)

Suggested order: P0 → P1 → P2 → P3 → P4 → P5 → P6 → P7 → P8 → D.

P3..P6 are largely independent of each other after P2's machinery
lands; multiple hands could parallelize. P7 (text) is gated on glyph
atlas decisions (parent §Q14, resolved as "atlas owned by webrender-
wgpu").

---

## 8. Receipts

- **P0**: `cargo check -p webrender` green; existing 7 wgpu device-
  side tests pass; servo-wgpu compiles against new signature.
- **P1**: `brush_solid`-only oracle scene pixel-matches through the
  renderer body's wgpu path (tolerance 0 default; documented
  per-scene tolerance only on root cause).
- **P2..P8**: each family's representative oracle scene matches.
- **D**: `cargo tree | grep -i gl` clean; binary works in
  servo-wgpu's compositor; parent plan §S4 oracle set fully passes
  through the wgpu path.

---

## 9. Risks

- **Each P slice is multi-day to multi-week.** Renderer-body surgery
  against a 5,316-LOC god object. Slow, careful, more compile / debug
  cycles per turn than design slices were.
- **P0 changes Servo's call site.** Pre-P0 tag on
  `idiomatic-wgpu-pipeline` for servo-wgpu to pin against until both
  sides land in lockstep.
- **Storage-buffer size limits.** `max_storage_buffer_binding_size`
  is typically 128 MB portable; gpu_cache may push this. Existing
  paging logic carries forward; verify pre-P1 (§10 Q2).
- **Per-family dispatch in the draw loop is transitional code that
  lives across P1..P8.** Each P slice slims it; D collapses it.
  Until D, both backends compile.
- **Async pipeline compile UX (parent §Q13).** First-run compile
  latency surfaces during P1+; warming UX shape decided alongside
  servo-wgpu compositor integration.
- **WGSL feature parity with GL-era usage.** Dynamic indexing into
  storage buffers, dual-source blending, override specialization
  bounds. Surface concrete cases as P slices encounter them; document
  here.
- **Reverted A2.X.5 commit (`ad655dc09`) preserved in branch
  history.** Documented as a misstep (independent boot was a hack).
  Branch history is honest about why.

---

## 10. Open questions

1. **Per-family dispatch shape.** A `match` on family kind in the
   renderer's draw loop is the simplest. Risk: two parallel branches
   become entrenched. Default: single `match` with a TODO grep
   target; revisit if it grows beyond ~50 LOC.
2. **`gpu_cache` as one storage buffer or many?** A single binding
   may exceed `max_storage_buffer_binding_size`; multiple bindings
   stress `max_storage_buffers_per_shader_stage`. Decide at P1
   entry against realistic gpu_cache size on the test machine and
   the portable wgpu adapters servo-wgpu targets.
3. **`ExternalTexture` design.** Embedder-supplied
   `wgpu::TextureView`. Materializes in P2 alongside texture-cache
   integration. Now naturally supported because embedder and
   webrender share one wgpu device (P0 handoff).
4. **Pipeline cache key shape.** Per-family vs. per-(family,
   format, override) keys. Default: per-(family, format, immediates)
   matches what `WgpuDevice::ensure_brush_solid` already does.
5. **Disposition of `core::boot()` after P0.** Stay test-only?
   Move to `core::test_boot` to make the boundary obvious in code?
   Default: gate behind `cfg(test)` initially; rename if tests
   acquire a separate fixture file.
6. **Oracle worktree retirement.** The oracle harness depends on
   `upstream/0.68` + GL Wrench at
   `../webrender-wgpu-oracle`. After D, can the worktree be retired?
   It still captures pixels for new scenes. Default: keep until
   parent §S4 oracle set is fully captured for the corpus we
   expect to test against.
7. **WGSL `const` vs. uniform buffer for dither.** A WGSL `const`
   inlines into every consuming shader (cheap at 64 bytes). A
   tiny uniform buffer would be shared. Default: `const` per
   shader unless multiple families converge on identical dither
   tables and the inline duplication becomes annoying.

---

## 11. Bottom line

Pipeline-first, family-by-family. Embedder owns the wgpu device.
Data-as-texture carriers get deleted, not migrated. The renderer's
main draw loop dispatches per-family during transition; once every
family migrates, GL deletion follows.

Start P0. The rest follows shader families in roughly increasing
complexity. P1 (`brush_solid`) is the largest single slice in the
plan because it forces every architectural decision in parent plan
§4.6–4.11 to land at once; subsequent slices reuse its machinery.

---

## 12. Appendix: GL → idiomatic wgpu translation

| GL shape | Idiomatic wgpu replacement | Pattern / notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Device` | `WgpuDevice` constructed via `with_external(handles)` | No internal boot in production. |
| `Texture` (data carrier) | `wgpu::Buffer` storage, read-only | gpu_cache, transforms, prim_headers, gpu_buffer_texture_f/i, vertex_data_textures. |
| `Texture` (image) | `wgpu::Texture` + `wgpu::TextureView` | Image cache, glyph atlas, render targets. |
| `ExternalTexture` | embedder-supplied `wgpu::TextureView` | Same wgpu device shared with embedder via P0 handoff. |
| `TextureSlot` | bind-group binding index (u32) | Compile-time slot, not runtime active-texture-unit. |
| `TextureFilter` | `wgpu::FilterMode` in a `wgpu::Sampler` | Sampler cache in `WgpuDevice` lands P2. |
| `TextureFlags` | _deleted_ | GL-specific. |
| `Program` / `ProgramBinary` / `ProgramCache` | `wgpu::RenderPipeline` + `wgpu::PipelineCache` | One pipeline per (family, format, override) key. |
| `ProgramCacheObserver` | _deleted_ | Cache observation is wgpu's. |
| `ShaderError` | wgpu validation error via `Result` | Surface naturally. |
| `VAO` | _deleted_ | Per-pass `set_vertex_buffer`. |
| `VertexAttribute` / `VertexAttributeKind` / `VertexDescriptor` | `wgpu::VertexAttribute` / `VertexFormat` / `VertexBufferLayout` | Per-pipeline. |
| `VertexUsageHint` | _ignored_ | wgpu manages buffer usage at allocation. |
| `UploadMethod` / `UploadPBOPool` | _deleted_ | `Queue::write_texture` is the replacement. |
| `DrawTarget` | `wgpu::TextureView` + `RenderPassTarget` policy | Color load / store declared at pass begin. |
| `ReadTarget` | `wgpu::Texture` with `COPY_SRC` usage | Adapter readback via `read_rgba8_texture`. |
| `FBOId` / `RBOId` / `VBOId` | _deleted_ | wgpu has no GL handles. |
| `DepthFunction` | `wgpu::CompareFunction` | Per-pipeline. |
| `FormatDesc` | `wgpu::TextureFormat` | Per-pipeline / per-texture. |
| `Texel` | `wgpu::TextureFormat` element type | For legit textures only. |
| `GpuFrameId` | unchanged (host-side counter) | Carry through. |
| `GpuProfiler` / `GpuTimer` | `wgpu::QuerySet` | Needs `Features::TIMESTAMP_QUERY`; lands when profiler integrates. |
| `GpuDebugMethod` / `GpuSampler` | _ignored or stubbed_ | |
| `Capabilities` | `wgpu::Features` + `wgpu::Limits` | Declared in `core::REQUIRED_FEATURES`. |
| `dither_matrix_texture` | WGSL `const DITHER` | 64 bytes — too small to be a binding; inline in consuming shaders. |
| `gpu_buffer_texture_f/i` | storage buffer, `read_only: true` | Per-frame structured table. |
| `transforms_texture` | storage buffer | Per-primitive transforms. |
| `prim_header_texture` | storage buffer | Per-primitive metadata. |
| `vertex_data_textures` | storage buffer (or vertex buffer if per-vertex) | Triple-buffer → wgpu submit-boundary semantics. |
| `gpu_cache_texture` | one or more storage buffers | Existing paging carries forward; access path changes. |
| `bind_program` / `bind_texture` / `set_uniform` | _deleted_ | Per-pass `set_pipeline` + `set_bind_group(offset)`; no mutable per-call binding state. |
| `get_gl_target` | _deleted_ | Texture descriptor carries the dimension. |
| `get_unoptimized_shader_source` | _deleted_ | WGSL is authored under `device/wgpu/shaders/`. |
| `clear_target(...)` mutable state | `RenderPassTarget` color / depth load policy | Declared at pass begin. |
| `invalidate_depth_target()` | `StoreOp::Discard` on depth attachment | Declared at pass begin. |
| Y-flip ortho carry | _deleted_ | Surface orientation declared explicitly. |
| CPU-side channel swaps | _deleted_ | wgpu pipeline state declared explicitly. |
| Manual blend tables | _deleted_ | wgpu blend state declared per pipeline. |
| Fixed-function emulation | _deleted_ | wgpu has no fixed-function. |
