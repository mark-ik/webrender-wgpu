# SPIR-V-Centered, Standards-First Shader Pipeline for `webrender-wgpu`

## Summary

Replace the current split shader flow:

- GL runtime consumes assembled/optimized GLSL
- `wgpu` runtime consumes build-generated WGSL

with a single build pipeline whose canonical runtime artifact is:

- SPIR-V stage binaries
- reflected shader metadata
- derived WGSL for `wgpu`
- derived GLSL for GL/GLES targets

The migration will keep authored GLSL as the initial input format, but move both
backends to consume generated artifacts from a shared registry. The plan is phased
so the `wgpu` backend lands first on the new artifact model, then GL/GLES follows
without stranding either backend.

Critical principle:

- existing WebRender GLSL is a migration input and a useful regression oracle
- it is not the normative standard for migrated shared shader variants
- the normative standards are SPIR-V, target GLSL/ESSL, and WGSL as defined by
  Khronos and W3C, validated by their tooling and conformance suites

The project should use GLSL to escape GLSL, not to remain quietly governed by it.

## Standards And Oracles

The architecture and validation strategy should explicitly anchor to external
standards instead of treating the current GL backend as the only well of truth.

Primary standards and tools:

- SPIR-V specification and grammar as the canonical IR contract
- Khronos `glslang` / `shaderc` as the reference GLSL/ESSL -> SPIR-V front-end
- Khronos `SPIRV-Tools` validator as the required SPIR-V validity gate
- SPIRV-Cross as the derivation tool for target GLSL/ESSL and reflection support
- W3C/GPUWeb WebGPU + WGSL specifications as the runtime contract for the `wgpu` path
- WebGPU CTS as the conformance oracle for WGSL/WebGPU behavior
- VK-GL-CTS as the conformance oracle for Vulkan, OpenGL, and OpenGL ES behavior

Oracle order for migrated shared shader variants:

1. valid canonical SPIR-V
2. valid reflected metadata
3. valid derived WGSL for WebGPU/wgpu
4. valid derived GLSL/ESSL for GL targets
5. WebRender image/output parity

The existing WebRender GLSL backend remains useful as:

- migration input
- behavior regression oracle
- implementation reference for intent

but not as the final normative center for migrated shader families.

## Key Changes

### 1. Introduce a canonical compiled-shader artifact model

Add a generated shader registry in `shader_source` that replaces the current split
`OPTIMIZED_SHADERS` / `UNOPTIMIZED_SHADERS` / `WGSL_SHADERS` view with one artifact
model per `(shader_name, config)` variant.

New generated types:

- `ShaderArtifactKey { name: &'static str, config: &'static str }`
- `ShaderStageArtifact`
  - `spirv_words: &'static [u32]`
  - `wgsl_source: &'static str`
  - `glsl_sources: TargetGlslSources`
  - `digest: &'static str`
- `ShaderMetadata`
  - vertex inputs by semantic name, location, and format
  - stage resource bindings by semantic resource name and fixed binding slot
  - target/profile availability flags
- `ShaderArtifact`
  - `key`
  - `metadata`
  - `vertex`
  - `fragment`

Artifact storage policy:

- SPIR-V, WGSL, GLSL, and metadata are generated into `OUT_DIR`
- registry code uses `include_bytes!` / `include_str!` to load them
- no generated shader artifacts are checked into the repo

Keep `WgpuShaderVariant` as the runtime-facing typed variant key, but make it resolve
through `ShaderArtifact` instead of `WGSL_SHADERS`.

Normative rule for migrated shared variants:

- build and runtime must be able to regenerate all consumed shader forms from the
  canonical SPIR-V artifact plus metadata
- no migrated shared variant may depend on hand-authored GLSL at runtime

### 2. Build a single shader compilation pipeline in `webrender_build`

Keep the existing shader assembly layer as the bootstrap input:

- `build_shader_strings` remains the place that expands imports and feature defines
- initial authoring remains `.glsl`
- feature enumeration continues to come from `shader_features.rs`

Add a new compiled-artifact pipeline with this exact flow:

1. Assemble per-stage GLSL from the current source tree and feature matrix
2. Normalize it to the Vulkan/SPIR-V compilation profile
3. Compile GLSL to SPIR-V with `shaderc`/glslang
4. Parse SPIR-V into naga IR for validation, metadata extraction, and WGSL generation
5. Cross-compile the same SPIR-V to target GLSL with SPIRV-Cross
6. Emit generated artifact files plus a registry module

Tool choices:

- GLSL -> SPIR-V: `shaderc` / `glslang`
- SPIR-V -> WGSL: `naga` with `spv-in` + `wgsl-out`
- SPIR-V -> GLSL/ESSL: SPIRV-Cross
- metadata extraction: from the parsed SPIR-V / naga module, not by parsing generated WGSL text

Important build-rule changes:

- move the current WGSL-only preprocessing logic out of the `wgpu`-specific path and split it into:
  - input normalization required before SPIR-V compilation
  - output normalization required after WGSL/GLSL generation
- make the build pipeline profile-aware:
  - canonical SPIR-V profile for shared variants
  - generated GLSL targets for `GL 150`, `GLES 300`
  - `ESSL 100` remains legacy-only until proven supportable through SPIR-V derivation

Compliance rule:

- if a migrated shared variant cannot be expressed as valid SPIR-V and then
  re-derived into valid target shaders, it is not considered fully migrated

### 3. Move the `wgpu` backend to artifact-driven runtime setup

Replace all runtime dependence on WGSL text shape with generated metadata.

Required runtime changes:

- `WgpuDevice` stops parsing WGSL entry-point text for vertex inputs
- `parse_wgsl_vertex_inputs` is deleted
- vertex layout construction uses `ShaderMetadata.vertex_inputs`
- pipeline creation uses `ShaderArtifact.vertex.wgsl_source` and `.fragment.wgsl_source`
- fixed binding validation uses reflected metadata to assert the generated WGSL still matches WebRender’s fixed binding model

Digesting/cache behavior:

- the canonical digest source becomes the SPIR-V artifact digest plus target profile marker
- `wgpu` pipeline cache keys continue to use typed shader variants, but the artifact digest is the source-of-truth fingerprint

Acceptance point for this phase:

- all currently enabled `wgpu` variants generate SPIR-V, WGSL, and metadata successfully
- all `wgpu` pipelines create successfully from generated WGSL and metadata
- no runtime WGSL parsing remains
- wasm-facing `wgpu` builds continue to consume WGSL plus metadata only; no wasm
  runtime path ingests SPIR-V directly

### 4. Move the GL backend to consume generated GLSL

After `wgpu` is stable on the artifact model, switch GL to consume derived GLSL from
the same artifact registry.

Required GL changes:

- `ProgramSourceInfo` and `Device::build_shader_string` stop being the runtime source-of-truth for migrated shader families
- GL program creation loads target-specific generated GLSL from `ShaderArtifact`
- program digests are computed from canonical artifact digests and target profile, not from ad hoc runtime string assembly
- program-cache keys remain target-specific so `Gl` and `Gles` binaries do not collide

Migration boundary for GL:

- first migrate the backend-intersection shader families and all families currently used by `wgpu`
- keep these GL-only families on the legacy GLSL path initially:
  - `TEXTURE_RECT`
  - `TEXTURE_EXTERNAL`
  - `TEXTURE_EXTERNAL_BT709`
  - `TEXTURE_EXTERNAL_ESSL1`
  - `ADVANCED_BLEND_EQUATION`
- maintain a dual registry during the transition:
  - `artifact-backed` variants
  - `legacy-glsl-only` variants

End-state rule:

- artifact-backed variants are consumed by both backends
- legacy-only variants are isolated behind explicit exceptions, not mixed into the main path
- once each remaining GL-only family has a verified SPIR-V route, remove its legacy path

Standards rule:

- migrated shared variants are judged first against Khronos/W3C validity and
  conformance expectations, then against existing WebRender behavior

## Implementation Sequence

### Phase 1: Artifact generation side-by-side

- Add a new `webrender_build` module for compiled shader artifacts
- Generate SPIR-V, WGSL, GLSL, and metadata without changing either runtime backend
- Keep current WGSL generation alive until parity checks pass
- Add a per-variant build report that records:
  - GLSL assembled successfully
  - SPIR-V compiled successfully
  - WGSL emitted successfully
  - target GLSL emitted successfully
  - metadata extracted successfully

### Phase 2: Switch `wgpu` to the new registry

- Make `wgpu` consume generated WGSL and metadata
- Remove WGSL text parsing from runtime
- Keep current GL path unchanged
- Fail the build if any `wgpu` variant lacks a complete artifact set

### Phase 3: Switch GL shared variants

- Make GL load generated GLSL for the shared/intersection variant set
- Keep GL-only extension families on the old path
- Change program digesting to artifact-based digests for migrated families
- Preserve current optimized/legacy behavior only for the remaining unmigrated families

### Phase 4: Retire duplicated generation paths

- Remove the old WGSL-only generation path
- Collapse shader registry generation onto the artifact model
- Shrink the legacy GLSL path to only the explicit GL-only exceptions
- Either migrate or permanently quarantine the remaining exception families

## Test Plan

### Build-time checks

- artifact generation succeeds for every variant in `get_shader_features` and `wgpu_shader_feature_flags`
- build fails on any missing stage artifact, missing metadata, or binding mismatch
- generated metadata is deterministic across builds
- artifact digests are stable for unchanged inputs
- every canonical SPIR-V module passes `spirv-val`
- target GLSL/ESSL emission is structurally valid for supported target profiles

### `wgpu` validation

- all generated WGSL modules load through `device.create_shader_module()`
- all render pipelines create successfully from generated artifacts
- current `wgpu_backends.rs` coverage still passes
- a parity test confirms generated metadata produces the same vertex layouts as the current hardcoded layout logic
- representative shader families are exercised against WebGPU/WGSL validation expectations, ideally through reusable CTS-style cases or imported CTS-inspired fixtures

### GL validation

- GL program creation succeeds for all migrated shared variants
- program cache digests remain stable and target-specific
- fallback remains correct for legacy-only GL extension families
- no migrated variant uses runtime GLSL assembly anymore
- representative migrated shared variants are checked against Khronos GL/ES expectations, using VK-GL-CTS-style coverage where practical

### Image/regression validation

- run the existing reftest/wrench suite on the migrated shared variants
- compare GL and `wgpu` output against current baseline for:
  - text
  - gradients
  - image brushes
  - composite passes
  - clip shaders
  - render-task/cache shaders
- add a targeted shader-artifact parity test that checks one representative variant from each family emits:
  - valid SPIR-V
  - valid WGSL
  - valid GL target source
- add a standards-oracle test report for migrated shared families:
  - SPIR-V validation status
  - WGSL validation/load status
  - GL target compile status
  - WebRender parity status

## Assumptions And Defaults

- Long-term canonical runtime artifact is generated SPIR-V plus reflected metadata
- Initial authored source remains GLSL only as a migration importer; it is not the normative standard for migrated shared variants
- Both backends are in scope, but migration is phased: `wgpu` first on the new artifact model, then GL shared variants, then GL-only exceptions
- Generated artifacts remain build outputs only; they are not checked into the repo
- `shaderc` / `glslang` are the GLSL -> SPIR-V compilers, `spirv-val` is required for SPIR-V validity, `naga` handles SPIR-V -> WGSL and metadata validation, and SPIRV-Cross handles SPIR-V -> GLSL/ESSL
- `ESSL 100` and other extension-heavy GL-only families stay on the legacy path until their SPIR-V derivation is explicitly validated
- `wasm32-unknown-unknown` remains a first-class portability constraint: wasm runtime paths consume generated WGSL and metadata, not SPIR-V directly
- No public embedders-facing renderer API changes are required; the meaningful interface changes are internal generated shader registry/types and backend device initialization logic
