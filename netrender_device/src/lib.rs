//! `netrender_device` — wgpu-native device foundation.
//!
//! Phase 0.5 of the netrender design plan
//! ([`netrender-notes/2026-04-30_netrender_design_plan.md`](../../netrender-notes/2026-04-30_netrender_design_plan.md))
//! splits the post-Phase-D wgpu skeleton out of `netrender` into this
//! foundation crate so the renderer-internal types can't leak into
//! consumers that only need the device + WGSL pipeline pattern.
//!
//! The public surface is intentionally narrow (see §3 "Crate-split
//! rationale" of the design plan). Implementation modules
//! (`binding`, `buffer`, `format`, `frame`, `pass` internals,
//! `pipeline` internals, `readback`, `shader`, `texture` internals)
//! are `pub(crate)`; only the items listed below escape the crate.
//!
//! ## Public items
//!
//! - [`WgpuDevice`], [`WgpuHandles`], [`REQUIRED_FEATURES`],
//!   [`BootError`] — adopt or boot the wgpu primitives.
//! - [`DrawIntent`], [`RenderPassTarget`], [`ColorAttachment`],
//!   [`DepthAttachment`] — record draws and target policy for
//!   `WgpuDevice::encode_pass`.
//! - [`BrushSolidPipeline`] + [`build_brush_solid_specialized`] —
//!   the smoke pipeline factory. Its primitive ABI gets re-decided
//!   at Phase 2; today it proves the device path renders correctly.
//! - [`WgpuTexture`], [`TextureDesc`] — texture creation surface.
